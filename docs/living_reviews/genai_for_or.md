> Li et al. introduce MIPLIB-NL, a benchmark of 223 industrial-scale MILP instances (up to 10^7 variables) reverse-engineered from MIPLIB 2017, enforcing strict model-data separation. Results are sobering: SOTA models like GPT-4 and fine-tuned OR-LLMs drop from ~90% accuracy on existing toy benchmarks to ~18% here, failing primarily on structural consistency and index handling at scale. For us, the key takeaway is their "Loop-Based Structural Scaffold" taxonomy—a method to compress massive industrial formulations into compact LLM prompts via model-data separation. This is a mandatory read for our OR-Bench project, as it demonstrates that current evaluations are effectively measuring overfitting to toy problems rather than genuine modeling capability.
