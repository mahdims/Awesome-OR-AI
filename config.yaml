        description: "Papers that apply formal operations research methods — integer/linear programming (ILP/MIP/LP), scheduling theory, queueing theory, combinatorial optimization formulations, or constraint programming — to optimize LLM and AI systems (serving, inference, GPU scheduling, resource allocation, model placement). Must use an actual OR formulation or mathematical program, not just heuristic engineering or systems tricks. Exclude papers that only benchmark or profile systems without an optimization model."
