| **2026-02-10** | <details><summary>**ImprovEvolve: Ask AlphaEvolve to Improve the Input Solution and Then Improvise**</summary>Kravatskiy et al. introduce ImprovEvolve, a framework that restricts the LLM to evolving `improve()` (local search) and `perturb()` (mutation) operators, which are then executed by a fixed basin-hopping algorithm. They achieve new state-of-the-art results on Hexagon Packing and the Second Autocorrelation Inequality, demonstrating that this modular approach generalizes to unseen problem sizes where monolithic AlphaEvolve solutions fail. The critical insight is that LLMs are poor at designing global search logic and tuning hyperparameters (LLM edits actively harmed performance), so we should isolate the LLM to generating local moves while keeping the meta-heuristic framework deterministic. We should immediately apply this 'operator-only' evolution strategy to our ALNS research for VRP.</details> | Alexey Kravatskiy et.al. | MIRIAI, FusionBrain Lab, Institute of Numerical Mathematics | — |
| **2026-02-09** | <details><summary>**G-LNS: Generative Large Neighborhood Search for LLM-Based Automatic Heuristic Design**</summary>G-LNS extends LLM-based evolutionary search to ALNS by co-evolving Python code for Destroy and Repair operators rather than constructive priority rules. The authors introduce a 'Synergy Matrix' that tracks the performance of specific operator pairs during evaluation, using this data to guide a 'Synergistic Joint Crossover' where the LLM optimizes the coupling between destroy and repair logic. Results are strong: it significantly outperforms FunSearch and EoH on TSP/CVRP and beats OR-Tools on large-scale instances (N=200) under time constraints. The key takeaway for AlgoEvo is the synergy-aware co-evolution mechanism—explicitly tracking and prompting for component interaction is a concrete technique we can apply to multi-agent optimization systems.</details> | Baoyun Zhao et.al. | Tsinghua University, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Northeastern University | **[link](https://github.com/zboyn/G-LNS)** |
| **2026-02-09** | <details><summary>**Lyria: A Genetic Algorithm-Driven Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning Framework for LLMs**</summary>Tang et al. propose Lyria, a hybrid evolutionary framework mixing LLM-based and symbolic operators for combinatorial problems, and LAFT, a method to fine-tune smaller models on the evolutionary search traces (e.g., successful crossovers). While their experiments are on toy instances (TSP-10) that offer no evidence of scalability for our VRP work, the LAFT approach provides a concrete mechanism to distill 'search intelligence' into smaller models. We should discuss adapting this fine-tuning strategy to capture the operator logic from our large-scale AlgoEvo runs, potentially improving sample efficiency for future searches.</details> | Weizhi Tang et.al. | University of Edinburgh | — |
| **2026-02-09** | <details><summary>**Game-Theoretic Co-Evolution for LLM-Based Heuristic Discovery**</summary>ASRO adapts Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) to code generation, treating heuristic discovery as a zero-sum game where a 'Solver' evolves to minimize gaps and a 'Generator' evolves to create adversarial instances. The results are compelling: it consistently beats the static EoH baseline on TSPLIB and CVRPLIB, proving that adversarial training yields better generalization than training on fixed distributions. The critical takeaway is the architecture: explicitly co-evolving an 'Instance Generator' program alongside the solver prevents overfitting and exposes edge cases (like specific geometric traps in TSP) that static benchmarks miss. This is a direct upgrade to our AlgoEvo/AlphaEvolve pipelines, though it incurs higher computational costs due to the evaluation matrix required for the meta-game.</details> | Xinyi Ke et.al. | Tsinghua University, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, AiRiA | — |

The results show that conditioning on the intermediate execution state (rendered image) reduces errors compared to text-only generation. For us, the only transferable insight is the data engineering tactic of transpiling verbose execution formats (like XML) into compact intermediate representations to save context window, and the proof-of-concept for 'execution-state-guided' constructive generation. However, the search method is primitive (backtracking on crash) and offers no value to our evolutionary search research.</details> | Jonas Belouadi et.al. | Adobe Research, University of Mannheim | — |

| 30/30 | **2025-06-16** | <details><summary>**AlphaEvolve: A coding agent for scientific and algorithmic discovery**</summary>AlphaEvolve extends FunSearch by evolving entire code files (rather than single functions) using a 'search/replace' diff format and Gemini 2.0, achieving SOTA results across matrix multiplication (beating Strassen), 50+ open math problems, and Google's production scheduling. The results are exceptionally strong and verified, including deployed improvements to Google's Borg scheduler (0.7% resource recovery) and TPU circuits. The critical takeaway is the move to **diff-based full-file evolution** and **meta-prompt evolution** (evolving the prompt instructions alongside the code), which allows the system to modify architecture and logic rather than just heuristics. This is a mandatory blueprint for the next iteration of our AlgoEvo and EvoCut projects.</details> | Alexander Novikov et.al. | Google DeepMind | **[link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-deepmind/alphaevolve_results/blob/master/mathematical_results.ipynb)** |
| 29/30 | **2026-01-22** | <details><summary>**Learning to Discover at Test Time**</summary>TTT-Discover introduces a method to fine-tune an LLM (gpt-oss-120b) *during* inference on a single test problem using RL, replacing the frozen-model evolutionary search of AlphaEvolve. They employ a novel 'entropic objective' that optimizes for the single best solution (discovery) rather than expected return, combined with PUCT-based state reuse. The results are empirically rigorous, setting new SOTA on Erdős’ problem, GPU kernel optimization, and AtCoder contests, directly beating AlphaEvolve and ShinkaEvolve. The critical takeaway is that for hard discovery tasks, shifting the model's distribution via online updates is superior to context-based search; we should immediately test their entropic objective in our AlgoEvo pipeline.</details> | Mert Yuksekgonul et.al. | Stanford University, NVIDIA, UC San Diego, Together AI, Astera Institute | **[link](https://github.com/test-time-training/discover)** |
| 28/30 | **2026-02-02** | <details><summary>**DeltaEvolve: Accelerating Scientific Discovery through Momentum-Driven Evolution**</summary>DeltaEvolve replaces the standard full-code history in evolutionary search with 'semantic deltas'—structured text summaries capturing the 'from/to' logic of modifications and their hypotheses. Across 5 domains (including BBOB and Symbolic Regression), they demonstrate superior objective scores over AlphaEvolve while reducing token consumption by ~37%. The critical takeaway is the 'Progressive Disclosure' mechanism: treating history as a momentum vector (deltas) rather than a state archive (snapshots) allows us to fit a deeper evolutionary trajectory into the context window. We should immediately test their 'Delta Plan' prompt structure in AlgoEvo to improve sample efficiency and reduce costs.</details> | Jiachen Jiang et.al. | Microsoft, The Ohio State University | — |
| 28/30 | **2025-12-30** | <details><summary>**LoongFlow: Directed Evolutionary Search via a Cognitive Plan-Execute-Summarize Paradigm**</summary>LoongFlow replaces the standard stochastic mutation operator in LLM evolutionary search with a 'Plan-Execute-Summarize' (PES) cognitive loop. Instead of random code changes, a Planner retrieves the 'intent' and 'summary' of the parent solution's lineage to generate a directed hypothesis, which is then executed and summarized for the next generation. The authors demonstrate a 60% reduction in evaluations and a 100% success rate on AlphaEvolve tasks where standard methods fail or stagnate. The critical takeaway is the 'Lineage-Based Context Retrieval' mechanism: explicitly passing the parent's plan and retrospective summary to the child allows for directed rather than random walks in the search space. We must implement this PES loop in AlgoEvo immediately to fix our sample efficiency issues.</details> | Chunhui Wan et.al. |  | **[link](https://github.com/baidu-baige/LoongFlow)** |
| 28/30 | **2025-11-28** | <details><summary>**ThetaEvolve: Test-time Learning on Open Problems**</summary>ThetaEvolve integrates test-time reinforcement learning (GRPO) directly into an AlphaEvolve-style loop, allowing a single 8B model to learn from its own successful mutations and achieve new SOTA bounds on Circle Packing and Autocorrelation inequalities. The results are rigorous, showing that RL applied to the *dynamic* environment (sampling from the evolving database) vastly outperforms RL on static prompts or pure inference search. The most stealable insight is the 'lazy penalty' mechanism—penalizing semantically equivalent code or stagnation—which forces the RL policy to learn genuine exploration strategies rather than memorization. This is a blueprint for the 'RL-infused evolution' milestone in our AlgoEvo roadmap.</details> | Yiping Wang et.al. | Microsoft, University of Washington, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Wisconsin-Madison, University of California, San Diego | **[link](https://github.com/ypwang61/ThetaEvolve)** |

| 21/30 | **2026-02-05** | <details><summary>**Mining Generalizable Activation Functions**</summary>Vitvitskyi et al. (DeepMind) utilize AlphaEvolve to discover novel activation functions by evolving Python code on small, synthetic datasets explicitly designed to test OOD generalization (e.g., polynomials, Feynman equations). The results are credible and backed by downstream transfer: discovered functions like `GELU * (1 + 0.5 sinc(x))` outperform baselines on algorithmic reasoning tasks (CLRS-30) while matching standard vision benchmarks. **Key Takeaway:** The 'Small-Scale Lab' methodology—optimizing on cheap, synthetic proxy tasks to find generalizable logic—is a validated strategy to bypass the computational bottleneck of evaluating evolved candidates on large-scale instances. We should steal this 'proxy evolution' setup for AlgoEvo to drastically reduce evaluation costs while targeting generalization in VRP heuristics.</details> | Alex Vitvitskyi et.al. | Google DeepMind |  | [2602.05688](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05688) | **[link](https://github.com/Aastha2104/Parkinson-Disease-Prediction)** |
| 24/30 | **2026-02-04** | <details><summary>**Landscape-aware Automated Algorithm Design: An Efficient Framework for Real-world Optimization**</summary>Yin et al. introduce a framework that decouples algorithm discovery from expensive evaluations by using Genetic Programming to evolve symbolic proxy functions that statistically match the target problem's landscape (via ELA features). Empirical results on photonics problems confirm that algorithms evolved on these cheap proxies transfer successfully to the real tasks, outperforming standard baselines like LSHADE with only 50×D real evaluations. **Key Takeaway:** We can synthesize 'symbolic gyms' that statistically mimic our target problems to run thousands of LLM iterations at near-zero cost. This directly addresses the sample efficiency bottleneck in AlgoEvo and suggests we should move beyond standard neural surrogates to evolved symbolic proxies.</details> | Haoran Yin et.al. |  |  | [2602.04529](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04529) | **[link](10.5281/zenodo.18385405)** |
| 19/30 | **2026-02-04** | <details><summary>**ProxyWar: Dynamic Assessment of LLM Code Generation in Game Arenas**</summary>ProxyWar introduces a tournament-based evaluation framework for LLM-generated code, using TrueSkill ratings from game simulations (Sudoku, Poker, etc.) instead of static unit tests. The results are robust (10k+ matches) and reveal a low correlation between Pass@1 and actual win rates; notably, 'reasoning' models like DeepSeek-R1 crush 'coding' models like Qwen-Coder in strategic tasks despite lower static scores. For our evolutionary search work, this confirms that we must move beyond static benchmarks to dynamic, competitive evaluation signals to avoid optimizing for syntax over strategy. We should also prioritize reasoning models over code-specialized ones for our agentic logic generation.</details> | Wenjun Peng et.al. |  |  | [2602.04296](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04296) | **[link](https://github.com/xinke-wang/ProxyWar)** |
| 26/30 | **2026-02-03** | <details><summary>**Contrastive Concept-Tree Search for LLM-Assisted Algorithm Discovery**</summary>The authors introduce Contrastive Concept-Tree Search (CCTS), which modifies the standard evolutionary loop by prompting the LLM to extract semantic 'concepts' from every generated program, building a dynamic hierarchy. They then apply a Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) to these concepts to learn a contrastive utility model (p(concept&#124;good)/p(concept&#124;bad)), using this to bias parent selection towards promising algorithmic strategies. Results are rigorous, showing consistent improvements over k-elite baselines on combinatorial tasks like Circle Packing, with a synthetic ablation confirming the model learns ground-truth concept utilities. **Key Takeaway:** We should immediately implement the 'Concept TPE' loop in AlgoEvo—asking the LLM to tag generated heuristics with concepts and maintaining a weight vector over these concepts provides a cheap, interpretable 'process reward model' to guide search.</details> | Timothee Leleu et.al. |  |  | [2602.03132](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03132) | — |
| 19/30 | **2026-02-03** | <details><summary>**Persona Generators: Generating Diverse Synthetic Personas at Scale**</summary>Paglieri et al. (DeepMind) apply AlphaEvolve to optimize Python code that generates synthetic personas, explicitly maximizing diversity metrics (convex hull, coverage) in embedding space rather than just fidelity. They achieve >80% coverage of the behavioral space compared to <50% for baselines, proving that evolving the *generator function* is more effective than prompting for diversity. The key takeaway is their two-stage architecture (autoregressive high-level trait generation $\to$ parallel detail expansion), which we should steal to evolve 'Solution Generators' for VRP/OR that inherently resist mode collapse. This validates our direction with AlgoEvo but offers a concrete architectural pattern for maintaining population diversity.</details> | Davide Paglieri et.al. | Google DeepMind |  | [2602.03545](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03545) | — |

| 21/30 | **2026-02-02** | <details><summary>**Automatic Design of Optimization Test Problems with Large Language Models**</summary>Achtelik et al. adapt LLM-driven evolutionary search (EoH) to generate interpretable Python functions that match specific landscape features (ELA), effectively creating synthetic benchmarks on demand. Unlike prior neural network approaches that fail to scale, this method performs robustly in higher dimensions (3D-5D) and produces portable code. The key takeaway is the capability to procedurally generate 'hard' or specific-property instances; we should immediately adopt this to create a dynamic training curriculum for AlgoEvo, ensuring our evolved metaheuristics generalize beyond standard libraries like BBOB.</details> | Wojciech Achtelik et.al. | AGH University of Krakow, Warsaw University of Technology |  | [2602.02724](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02724) | **[link](https://github.com/chrisneagu/FTC-Skystone-Dark-Angels-Romania-2020)** |
| 24/30 | **2026-02-01** | <details><summary>**Evolving Interdependent Operators with Large Language Models for Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization**</summary>E2OC introduces a hierarchical search framework where MCTS optimizes 'design thoughts' (textual strategies) rather than raw code, subsequently using these strategies to guide a coordinate-descent-style evolution of interdependent operators. While the computational cost is high due to the inner-loop operator rotation, the results on FJSP/TSP (+20% HV vs expert) and comparisons against FunSearch/EoH demonstrate that explicitly modeling operator coupling is superior to isolated evolution. The critical takeaway for us is the **'strategy-first' search layer**: evolving a semantic blueprint for component interaction *before* code generation prevents the local optima trap of independent component optimization, a technique we should immediately test in AlgoEvo.</details> | Junhao Qiu et.al. |  |  | [2601.17899](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17899) | **[link](null)** |
| 24/30 | **2026-01-29** | <details><summary>**READY: Reward Discovery for Meta-Black-Box Optimization**</summary>READY introduces a multi-task evolutionary framework where LLMs evolve reward functions for multiple MetaBBO algorithms simultaneously, utilizing explicit 'Knowledge Transfer' operators to translate successful logic between distinct tasks. The results are robust, demonstrating superior performance over Eureka and EoH on BBOB benchmarks with a 2-4x reduction in search time due to parallelization and shared heuristics. The most stealable insights are the 'History-Reflection' operator—which prompts the LLM to extrapolate trends from the evolutionary trajectory rather than just mutating the current state—and the cross-niche transfer mechanism, both of which should be implemented in our multi-agent optimization stack immediately.</details> | Zechuan Huang et.al. |  |  | [2601.21847](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21847) | **[link](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ICML_READY-747F)** |
| 26/30 | **2026-01-29** | <details><summary>**LLaMEA-SAGE: Guiding Automated Algorithm Design with Structural Feedback from Explainable AI**</summary>LLaMEA-SAGE augments LLM-based evolutionary search by extracting AST features (complexity, graph metrics) from generated code, training a surrogate model to predict fitness from these features, and using SHAP analysis to generate natural language prompts that guide the LLM to modify specific structural properties (e.g., 'increase cyclomatic complexity'). On the MA-BBOB benchmark, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods (MCTS-AHD, LHNS) and converges faster than vanilla LLaMEA, although the authors honestly report that statistical significance was limited (p=0.44) due to small sample sizes (5 runs). The critical takeaway for us is the pipeline of using static code analysis as a feedback signal—we can immediately steal this 'SAGE' loop to guide AlgoEvo or EvoCut by telling the LLM *how* to structurally mutate code based on surrogate correlations, rather than just hoping for random improvements.</details> | Niki van Stein et.al. |  |  | [2601.21511](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21511) | **[link](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLaMEA-SAGE/README.md)** |
| 27/30 | **2026-01-29** | <details><summary>**TIDE: Tuning-Integrated Dynamic Evolution for LLM-Based Automated Heuristic Design**</summary>TIDE introduces a nested evolutionary framework that strictly decouples algorithmic structure generation (via LLM) from numerical parameter tuning (via Differential Evolution), managed by a Tree Similarity Edit Distance (TSED) guided island model. Results on 9 COPs (TSP, BPP, etc.) show it consistently outperforms ReEvo and EoH, primarily because the DE layer optimizes constants at zero token cost, preventing the discard of structurally sound but poorly tuned heuristics. The critical takeaway is the necessity of a gradient-free tuning layer for LLM-generated code; relying on LLMs for numerical constants is inefficient and imprecise. We should immediately implement a similar parameter-tuning inner loop in our AlgoEvo framework.</details> | Chentong Chen et.al. |  |  | [2601.21239](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21239) | — |
| 24/30 | **2026-01-29** | <details><summary>**PathWise: Planning through World Model for Automated Heuristic Design via Self-Evolving LLMs**</summary>PathWise reformulates heuristic discovery as a sequential planning problem over an 'Entailment Graph,' where a Policy Agent generates high-level evolutionary directives (rationales) and a World Model executes the code, guided by specific Critic reflections. The results are robust: it outperforms ReEvo, FunSearch, and MCTS-AHD on TSP, CVRP, and Bin Packing while using half the evaluation budget (500 vs 1000), demonstrating genuine sample efficiency. The key takeaway is the **Entailment Graph** structure: explicitly storing the *derivation rationale* and lineage allows the LLM to reason about the search trajectory and avoid redundant failures, a mechanism we should immediately adapt for AlgoEvo to fix our memory bottleneck.</details> | Oguzhan Gungordu et.al. |  |  | [2601.20539](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20539) | — |
| 24/30 | **2026-01-28** | <details><summary>**Magellan: Autonomous Discovery of Novel Compiler Optimization Heuristics with AlphaEvolve**</summary>Magellan couples AlphaEvolve with a black-box autotuner (Vizier) to evolve C++ compiler heuristics, achieving >5% binary size reduction in LLVM and beating both human experts and prior neural policies. The results are rigorous, validated on production workloads and showing temporal generalization. **The critical takeaway is the 'Hierarchical Search' strategy:** rather than asking the LLM to write fully specified code, they prompt it to generate *templates* with exposed parameters (flags), delegating numerical tuning to a cheap external optimizer. This directly addresses the sample efficiency issues we face in AlgoEvo; we should immediately steal this architecture to separate structural evolution from parameter tuning.</details> | Hongzheng Chen et.al. | Google DeepMind, Google, Cornell University |  | [2601.21096](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21096) | — |
| 20/30 | **2026-01-27** | <details><summary>**Algorithmic Prompt-Augmentation for Efficient LLM-Based Heuristic Design for A Search**</summary>This paper introduces 'Algorithmic-Contextual EoH' (A-CEoH), which injects the actual source code of the search algorithm (e.g., the A* driver loop, neighbor generation) into the LLM prompt alongside the problem description. Experiments on the Unit-Load Pre-Marshalling Problem and Sliding Puzzle Problem demonstrate that this algorithmic context allows a 32B parameter model (Qwen2.5-Coder) to generate heuristics superior to those from GPT-4o and human experts. The results are credible and backed by comparisons against optimal baselines. The key takeaway is a transferable 'prompt trick': explicitly showing the LLM the code that *calls* its generated function aligns the heuristic significantly better with the search dynamics than natural language descriptions alone. We should immediately test injecting our ALNS/search driver code into our evolutionary prompt templates.</details> | Thomas Bömer et.al. |  | EvoStar conference; Code: https://github | [2601.19622](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19622) | **[link](https://github.com/tb-git-tud/a-ceoh-evolution-of-heuristics)** |
| 21/30 | **2026-01-27** | <details><summary>**CASTER: Breaking the Cost-Performance Barrier in Multi-Agent Orchestration via Context-Aware Strategy for Task Efficient Routing**</summary>CASTER implements a context-aware neural router for multi-agent systems that dynamically selects between weak and strong models, reducing inference costs by ~72% compared to a GPT-4o-only baseline. The authors validate this on a custom benchmark across four domains, showing it outperforms cascading strategies (FrugalGPT) by avoiding the 'double-billing' of failed weak calls. The standout takeaway for us is the 'On-Policy Negative Feedback' mechanism: training the router by explicitly relabeling instances where the weak model failed as 'Strong-Required'. We should adapt this active learning logic to train our proxy reward models in AlgoEvo, allowing us to reliably offload expensive evaluations to cheaper proxies without manual annotation.</details> | Shanyv Liu et.al. | University of Houston, China University of Petroleum (East China), Southwest Jiaotong University |  | [2601.19793](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19793) | — |

The results are rigorous: they disprove the output-polynomial time of the Nemhauser-Ullmann algorithm and improve the Best-Fit bin packing bound to 1.5. The key takeaway for our AlgoEvo work is the workflow: the LLM finds 'messy' structural patterns (e.g., repeated floats) which humans then manually generalize into asymptotic proofs. This validates Program Search over vector search but exposes the 'generalization gap'—we should implement a post-processing agent to automate this manual refinement step.</details> | Henri Nikoleit et.al. | Google DeepMind, University of Bonn, University of Manitoba |  | [2601.16849](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16849) | **[link](https://github.com/lumi-a/funsearch)** |

They expand 400 seed families to over 21k instances, achieving consistent gains on AIME (+3.0) and SynLogic (+5.2) via RLVR. **Crucial Takeaway:** We should steal the 'Blind Review' mechanism for AlgoEvo—using the solvability of a generated problem (by an independent code agent) as a strict fitness filter for the generator itself. This directly addresses our bottleneck in filtering invalid or hallucinated heuristics during evolutionary search.</details> | Bowen Liu et.al. | Tencent, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) |  | [2602.13218](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13218) | **[link](https://github.com/AdAstraAbyssoque/Scaling-the-Scaling-Logic)** |

The core contribution is the **Hybrid Evaluation** mechanism, where the Evaluator generates qualitative critiques (strengths/weaknesses) that are injected into the Generator's prompts to guide specific operators like 'Dominance-Fusion Crossover' and 'Directed Optimization.' Empirical results show it outperforms FunSearch and EOH, avoiding the premature convergence seen in other methods. The most stealable insight is the prompt structure for crossover: rather than blindly combining code, it uses the Evaluator's analysis of parent strengths to direct the merger, a technique we should implement to improve sample efficiency in our evolutionary search.</details> | Junhao Qiu et.al. |  |  | [2601.15738](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15738) | — |

They employ a novel 'entropic objective' that optimizes for the single best solution (discovery) rather than expected return, combined with PUCT-based state reuse. The results are empirically rigorous, setting new SOTA on Erdős’ problem, GPU kernel optimization, and AtCoder contests, directly beating AlphaEvolve and ShinkaEvolve. The critical takeaway is that for hard discovery tasks, shifting the model's distribution via online updates is superior to context-based search; we should immediately test their entropic objective in our AlgoEvo pipeline.</details> | Mert Yuksekgonul et.al. | Stanford University, NVIDIA, UC San Diego, Together AI, Astera Institute |  | [2601.16175](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16175) | **[link](https://github.com/test-time-training/discover)** |

Results on FJSP benchmarks (Brandimarte, Fattahi) show a 3-4% improvement over static GA and GP, with convergence plots demonstrating that LLM interventions successfully break local optima. The most stealable insight is the 'Perception and Analysis' prompt structure: it forces the LLM to explicitly diagnose *why* the current population is stuck (based on fitness stats) before generating new code, a mechanism we should port to AlgoEvo to handle search stagnation. This validates the viability of online, state-aware LLM intervention in OR scheduling problems.</details> | Rongjie Liao et.al. | City University of Hong Kong, Guangdong University of Technology |  | [2511.16485](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16485) | — |

The results are rigorous, improving on 'newly discovered' solutions within minutes using default solver settings. **CRITICAL TAKEAWAY:** We must validate our AlgoEvo results against classical global solvers to ensure we aren't claiming 'discovery' on problems that are trivial for SCIP; furthermore, it suggests a hybrid path where LLMs generate NLP models for solvers rather than evolving raw heuristic code. This is a necessary reality check for our benchmarking strategy.</details> | Timo Berthold et.al. |  |  | [2601.05943](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05943) | — |

By enforcing functional disentanglement (using attention strictly for routing and MLPs for arithmetic) and employing temperature-annealed sampling, they recover symbolic laws for arithmetic and physics tasks with near-zero error. The critical takeaway is their 'continuous-to-discrete homotopy' strategy—annealing from soft to hard selection during training—which enables differentiable search to converge on discrete, symbolic solutions. This suggests a viable path to discover heuristics via continuous optimization rather than purely stochastic LLM evolution.</details> | Yifan Zhang et.al. |  | arXiv.org | [2601.05770](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05770) | — |

The results are strong and backed by numbers: they beat AlphaEvolve on 5/9 benchmarks and demonstrate that Qwen3-Coder-30B matches Gemini-2.5 performance at ~10% of the cost. The single most useful takeaway is the implementation of the 'inspiration' operator and the necessity of MAP-Elites over simple elitism to escape local optima in code space.

Instead of random code changes, a Planner retrieves the 'intent' and 'summary' of the parent solution's lineage to generate a directed hypothesis, which is then executed and summarized for the next generation. The authors demonstrate a 60% reduction in evaluations and a 100% success rate on AlphaEvolve tasks where standard methods fail or stagnate. The critical takeaway is the 'Lineage-Based Context Retrieval' mechanism: explicitly passing the parent's plan and retrospective summary to the child allows for directed rather than random walks in the search space. We must implement this PES loop in AlgoEvo immediately to fix our sample efficiency issues.</details> | Chunhui Wan et.al. |  | arXiv.org | [2512.24077](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24077) | **[link](https://github.com/baidu-baige/LoongFlow)** |

Results are rigorous, establishing new bounds on Kakeya sets and 10+ other problems by exploiting verifier loopholes and heuristic specialization. The most critical takeaway for AlgoEvo is Section 44: evolving code that *calls* other LLMs leads to emergent prompt optimization and injection strategies, suggesting a path for our multi-agent optimization work.

The results are real and backed by code, comparing frameworks like OpenEvolve, GEPA, and ShinkaEvolve. **Key Takeaway:** Their 'Best Practices' section offers concrete engineering constraints we should adopt: specifically, that 'moderate' feedback (worst-k cases) outperforms 'detailed' feedback (prevents overfitting), and that restricting mutations to diff-based edits is essential to prevent reward hacking.

The results are strong: it outperforms AlphaEvolve and FunSearch styles on NAS-Bench-Zero by explicitly preserving diversity and enabling surgical, data-driven pruning rather than blind mutation. The critical takeaway is the 'alternative-level statistic' mechanism: by aggregating performance across all paths a component participates in, they generate a high-fidelity signal that tells the LLM exactly which lines of code are working, effectively solving the sparse reward problem in code evolution. We should immediately discuss refactoring our AlgoEvo representation to support this multi-alternative graph structure, as it maximizes signal extraction per LLM call.</details> | Kamer Ali Yuksel et.al. | aiXplain Inc | arXiv.org | [2512.13857](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13857) | — |

The results demonstrate a massive performance jump on constrained Aircraft Landing problems (from ~56% with FunSearch to 100% with their method), suggesting that static prompts are a primary failure mode for complex OR constraints.

While the empirical gains over ReEvo are marginal (often <1%) and likely expensive in token cost, the architecture successfully demonstrates how to embed structured multi-agent reasoning into the evolutionary loop to stabilize black-box search.

While the experiments rely on synthetic data for agriculture and EV charging, the approach outperforms DSPy and AutoGen baselines in driving collective action. The most valuable takeaway is the architectural separation of 'policy discovery' (code evolution) and 'adoption mechanism' (message evolution)—a pattern we could adapt to evolve incentive structures or negotiation protocols in our multi-agent optimization systems (MASPRM/HERMES).

The results are rigorous, showing that RL applied to the *dynamic* environment (sampling from the evolving database) vastly outperforms RL on static prompts or pure inference search. The most stealable insight is the 'lazy penalty' mechanism—penalizing semantically equivalent code or stagnation—which forces the RL policy to learn genuine exploration strategies rather than memorization.

Results are negative but instructive, showing that direct prompting (GPT-5) sometimes outperforms evolution on these tasks. The key takeaway is the specific categorization of how LLMs cheat objective functions in code generation—specifically by substituting computation (search) for insight (construction)—and the finding that code embedding diversity does not imply functional diversity.

The results are credible and backed by code, specifically highlighting that 'rewrite-based' mutation outperforms 'diff-based' approaches for open-weights models—a crucial engineering constraint for us. The most actionable takeaway is their 'bidirectional lineage tracking' mechanism, which enriches mutation prompts by analyzing both how a program improved over its ancestor and how its descendants further improved, a technique we should steal for AlgoEvo's mutation operator.

The results are rigorous, validating 385 formulas and unifying 43% of them into a single mathematical structure. The key takeaway for us is the strategy of using 'canonical forms' and empirical invariants (like convergence rates or irrationality measures) to fingerprint and cluster symbolic expressions; this concept could theoretically be adapted to deduplicate evolved heuristics in AlgoEvo if analogous invariants for code behavior were defined.

D-ID3 is particularly novel: instead of evolving a global heuristic, it calls the LLM at *each split node* to generate a feature that discriminates the specific data subset at that leaf. Results are strong on Chess (matching Transformers trained on 250x more data) and Text, though the Image results (MNIST) are trivial. **Key Takeaway:** The D-ID3 architecture—using the solver's current state (leaf node data) to prompt the LLM for *local* code generation—is a powerful pattern we should steal for our VRP solvers (e.g., evolving local repair operators for specific route bottlenecks) and EvoCut work.</details> | Gabriel Poesia et.al. | Harvard University, Stanford University | arXiv.org | [2510.14825](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14825) | **[link](https://github.com/gpoesia/leapr/)** |

Unlike typical prompting papers, they demonstrate that a small, specialized model can improve upon expert-designed components in a highly optimized solver, achieving superior results on CVRPLIB (up to 1000 nodes) where GPT-4o fails. The most stealable insight is their **AST-based anti-plagiarism reward**, which penalizes the model for generating code structurally identical to the prompt examples, effectively forcing exploration and preventing mode collapse—a technique we should immediately adopt for our evolutionary search agents.

They demonstrate a 28x improvement in worst-case performance over FunSearch on traffic engineering tasks, with results backed by rigorous comparison against optimal solvers. The critical takeaway is the 'Suggester' intermediate step: converting raw failure instances into natural language coding strategies significantly improves the LLM's ability to fix logic bugs compared to raw samples alone. We should immediately attempt to replicate this 'Analyzer -> Explainer -> Coder' loop for our VRP work, using small-scale solvers to generate counter-examples for our evolved ALNS operators.</details> | Pantea Karimi et.al. | Microsoft, MIT, Microsoft Research, University of Southern California, The University of Texas at Austin | arXiv.org | [2510.08755](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08755) | — |

While the '666%' improvement on Circle Packing is likely due to a weak baseline (fixed-size vs. generalized), the engineering results are compelling: the debugging agent raises execution success rates from ~13% to ~99% in complex tasks. The key takeaway for our AlgoEvo work is the architecture of generating a text-based 'research proposal' via RAG before attempting code generation, rather than mutating code directly. We should immediately adopt their debugging loop and consider injecting external literature search into our mutation operators to prevent search stagnation.</details> | Gang Liu et.al. | MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, IBM Research, University of Notre Dame | arXiv.org | [2510.06056](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06056) | **[link](https://github.com/liugangcode/deepevolve)** |

They report dominating performance over FunSearch and ReEvo on TSP and BPP (e.g., reducing Christofides gap from ~20% to ~5%), though the static performance of baselines suggests the gain comes largely from automating prompt engineering. The most stealable insight is the **Strategy Sampling** module: explicitly defining a pool of mutation operators and using an 'experience' buffer to select them is a practical implementation of the 'planner' concept we need for AlgoEvo. We should also adopt their island migration topology to improve diversity in our parallelized search.</details> | Yihong Liu et.al. | Tencent, Renmin University of China, City University of Hong Kong | arXiv.org | [2509.24509](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24509) | **[link](null)** |

The results are strong, outperforming ADAS and MaAS on standard benchmarks while maintaining Pareto efficiency. The critical takeaway for us is the **Rectifier agent**: rather than discarding failed evolutionary candidates (as we currently do in AlgoEvo), we should implement a dedicated loop to patch runtime errors (e.g., API failures, dimension mismatches). Additionally, their 'Collaborative Tree Optimization' offers a rigorous method to fine-tune the 'Evolver' model using trajectory data, which could replace our current prompt-based meta-heuristics.</details> | Kun Wang et.al. | NTU, NUS, USTC, ZJU, BUAA, PKU | arXiv.org | [2509.24323](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24323) | **[link](https://github.com/yeyeyeah2/MAS2)** |

The authors introduce a 'voting score' fitness function—calculated via Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of an individual's contribution to sampled groups—which successfully drives the population toward diverse, complementary strategies that outperform ensembles of individually optimized prompts (beating AlphaEvolve by ~4% on Qwen3-8B). The single most actionable takeaway is the **EMA voting score mechanism**: we can steal this exact fitness formulation to evolve portfolios of complementary VRP heuristics in AlgoEvo, replacing our current focus on converging to a single 'best' solver. While the benchmarks are standard (MATH, HotpotQA), the method offers a robust solution to the 'single heuristic limitation' we face in OR.</details> | Tiancheng Li et.al. | Westlake University | arXiv.org | [2509.23331](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23331) | — |

Results are strong and verified: it boosts a base agent from 20% to 50% on SWE-bench Verified, matching handcrafted SoTA, with ablations proving the necessity of the population archive (open-endedness) over single-lineage hill climbing. **Key Takeaway:** The 'self-diagnosis' mechanism—feeding execution logs to a model to propose specific *architectural* code changes (e.g., implementing a 'str_replace' tool to fix granular editing errors)—is the exact mechanism we need to implement for evolving our heuristic searchers. This validates that LLM-driven code evolution is viable for complex logic improvement, not just toy tasks.</details> | Jenny Zhang et.al. | Sakana AI, Vector Institute, University of British Columbia, Canada CIFAR AI Chair | Robotics | [2505.22954](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22954) | **[link](https://github.com/jennyzzt/dgm)** |

On geospatial interpolation tasks, they report 13-21% error reduction over standard evolution, with ablations confirming that retrieved domain knowledge—not just iterative feedback—drives the performance gain. The critical takeaway is the architectural pattern of 'Knowledge-Guided Evolution': instead of relying on the LLM's internal weights for domain theory, they explicitly retrieve and inject theoretical priors (e.g., valid variogram definitions) to steer the search. We should adapt this 'Theory-RAG' outer loop for our AlgoEvo pipeline to force evolved VRP heuristics to respect OR theoretical bounds.</details> | Peng Luo et.al. | Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University, Technical University of Munich | arXiv.org | [2509.21593](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21593) | — |

The results are rigorous, using controlled OOD tasks to prove that TTFT relies on in-distribution priors rather than reasoning. The critical takeaway for our AlgoEvo work is the architecture of the 'state-conditioned decoder': instead of blind code generation, we should inject the tokenized execution result of step $t$ into the context for step $t+1$.

The approach uses a standard meta-optimization loop where the LLM refines the update formula based on historical performance and constraint violations. While the 'RTO2H' prompt framework is generic, the result suggests that LLMs can implicitly learn constraint-handling strategies (replacing manual penalty tuning), which is a relevant proof-of-concept for our AlgoEvo work, even if the continuous domain doesn't directly transfer to VRP.</details> | Xu Yang et.al. | National University of Defense Technology | arXiv.org | [2509.13251](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13251) | — |

The results are credible, backed by code from Sakana AI, and directly target our primary pain point of high API costs/sample inefficiency in evolutionary search. **Key Takeaway:** We must implement their 'novelty rejection sampling' immediately—using a cheap embedding model to filter out semantically similar code mutations (threshold 0.95) before execution is a trivial but high-impact optimization for our AlgoEvo pipeline. This paper proves that smart filtering is superior to the brute-force compute strategies we have been relying on.</details> | Robert Tjarko Lange et.al. | Sakana AI | arXiv.org | [2509.19349](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19349) | **[link](https://github.com/SakanaAI/ShinkaEvolve)** |

They find that while LLMs are sample-efficient for simple functions, they catastrophically fail to incorporate high-dimensional input features (e.g., the 20+ inputs in OPEN), where Black-box ES remains superior. The most actionable takeaway is 'Same-Size Distillation': distilling a learned black-box algorithm into a fresh network of identical size using synthetic data consistently improves out-of-distribution generalization with zero additional environment samples. We should implement this distillation step immediately and reconsider using LLMs for feature-heavy heuristic components.</details> | Alexander David Goldie et.al. | University of Oxford | arXiv.org | [2507.17668](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17668) | **[link](https://github.com/AlexGoldie/learn-rl-algorithms)** |

The results are highly rigorous, backed by 90k CPU hours of distributed evaluation and strict correctness proofs (DRAT), showing a clear monotonic improvement trajectory. The single most stealable insight is the **self-evolving rule system**: the agent autonomously updates a persistent set of markdown constraints (e.g., forbidden patterns, testing protocols) based on post-cycle failure analysis, effectively creating 'institutional memory' that prevents regression in long-horizon search. We must implement this meta-learning loop in AlgoEvo immediately to move beyond single-file optimization.</details> | Cunxi Yu et.al. | NVIDIA Research, University of Maryland | arXiv.org | [2509.07367](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07367) | — |

The results are soberingly realistic: while the scaffolded LLM matches greedy baselines on simple instances, it fails to generalize to complex constraints (stability, separation), significantly trailing human-designed metaheuristics. The key takeaway is their observation that the LLM exclusively optimizes the *scoring function* (weights/priorities) rather than the algorithmic structure, effectively reducing 'code evolution' to 'parameter tuning.' This confirms a critical limitation for our AlgoEvo work: simply asking for code results in local optimization; we must force structural changes or provide better primitives to get true novelty.</details> | Guorui Quan et.al. | The University of Manchester | arXiv.org | [2509.02297](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02297) | **[link](https://github.com/quangr/EoH)** |

While they claim significant gains over EvoPrompt (e.g., +28% on BBH), the methodology is a straightforward port of ReEvo combined with standard roulette-wheel selection, offering no new architectural insights. The results serve as a data point confirming that verbalizing mutation strategies ('reflection') helps in discrete spaces, but the paper lacks the statistical rigor or methodological novelty to warrant attention over the original ReEvo work.

The results are empirically backed and highlight a critical limitation: LLM-ES failed to reconstruct the exact full Kalman Filter where traditional CGP succeeded, likely due to precision issues in symbolic reconstruction. The main takeaway is that for exact mathematical structure discovery, traditional symbolic mutation (CGP) still holds an edge over 14B-parameter LLM evolution, suggesting we should not fully abandon symbolic operators in our AILS-II control discovery pipeline. It also validates that open-weights 14B models are sufficient for FunSearch-style loops.</details> | Vasileios Saketos et.al. | Harvard University, KTH Stockholm | arXiv.org | [2508.11703](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11703) | — |

The standout technique is the 'Adversarial Collaborator Graph,' which calculates attention scores between agent trajectories to identify the specific subset of 'collaborator' agents that, if perturbed, maximize the adversarial impact. Results are strong (+31% collision rate vs. baselines in CARLA) and validated in real-world closed courses.

Results are strong and credible: on TSPLib and CVRPLib, their set of 10 heuristics reduces the optimality gap by ~40-60% compared to the top 10 heuristics from FunSearch or ReEvo. **KEY TAKEAWAY:** We should replace standard elitist selection in AlgoEvo with their 'Complementary Population Management' (CPM). By greedily selecting individuals based on marginal contribution to instance coverage (using instance-wise performance vectors), we can automatically generate diverse operator pools for ALNS instead of relying on hand-crafted diversity metrics.</details> | Fei Liu et.al. | Huawei Noah

The standout contribution is **semantics-aware crossover**: rather than selecting parents based solely on scalar fitness, they compute complementarity scores using performance vectors across instances, explicitly retrieving parents that solve different subsets of the problem. This effectively treats parent selection as a retrieval task based on behavioral signatures, ensuring the LLM combines distinct functional capabilities. We should immediately implement this complementarity-based parent retrieval in AlgoEvo to improve how we merge heuristics.</details> | Hengzhe Zhang et.al. | Victoria University of Wellington, Michigan State University |  | [2505.18602](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18602) | **[link](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Meta-SR/)** |

The results are robust, consistently outperforming static FunSearch on Bin Packing, TSP, and Hash Code benchmarks by discovering better heuristics faster. The critical takeaway is the use of **Forward KL regularization** in DPO instead of the standard Reverse KL; this prevents the mode collapse that usually kills evolutionary diversity, allowing the model to learn from high-fitness samples while maintaining exploration.

While they achieve a 5.8% gap reduction on Bin Packing over single-heuristic baselines, the approach requires massive offline compute to generate thousands of scripts. The key takeaway is a negative result: using an LLM to select the best heuristic from candidates yielded negligible gains (0.1%) over simple feature-based distance, suggesting we should avoid LLM-based selector agents for this task.

While they claim to beat Mathematica on synthetic benchmarks, the reliance on visual plotting is a non-starter for our complex algorithmic logic. However, the **KAN decomposition strategy**—reducing a hard multivariate symbolic search into independent, simpler univariate searches—is a valuable architectural insight. We could steal this 'Train KAN -> Regress Edges' workflow to extract interpretable symbolic constraints or heuristics from neural baselines without searching the full multivariate space directly.</details> | Thomas R.

The results are empirically weak due to a lack of statistical rigor (single runs) and extreme inefficiency: the method required 35-38 days of runtime and suffered a ~50% failure rate where the LLM generated invalid YAMLs. We learn that evolving configuration files via simple prompting is viable but prohibitively expensive compared to code evolution; this confirms the necessity of the constraint handling and reward modeling techniques we are already developing.

The critical takeaway for us is their **functional deduplication** step: they hash function outputs on a small subset of data to discard syntactically unique but logically identical programs, which significantly improves sample efficiency by preventing the evaluator from wasting cycles on 'comment changes' or variable renames. Additionally, they demonstrate that optimizing for the single hardest instance generalizes better than averaging performance across a curriculum—a counter-intuitive finding we should test in our reward modeling.</details> | Franziska Weindel et.al. | Technical University of Munich, Munich Center for Machine Learning | arXiv.org | [2504.00613](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00613) | **[link](https://github.com/MLI-lab/FunDCC)** |

They demonstrate that LLM-generated algorithms can match baselines like DE and CMA-ES on continuous physics benchmarks. The only potentially useful takeaway is their negative result: detailed domain-specific prompts actually *degraded* performance on noisy fitness landscapes by prematurely constraining exploration.

Their results are backed by extensive runs, demonstrating that cheaper models (e.g., Mistral) often match GPT-4o in this loop and that long evolutionary runs suffer from path dependence, making frequent restarts more efficient. The most actionable insight is that mathematically equivalent problem formulations (e.g., greedy adding vs. greedy removal of points) yield drastically different search landscapes for the LLM. We should immediately apply this 'formulation variation' strategy to our VRP heuristic evolution (e.g., evolving destruction operators vs. construction operators explicitly) and shift budget toward parallel short runs with smaller models.</details> | Jordan S.

On TSP benchmarks, they report reducing optimality gaps by ~2-5% compared to ReEvo, and in quadratic optimization, the system autonomously discovered numerical stability fixes (e.g., replacing matrix inversion with solvers) that human baselines missed. The critical takeaway is the 'bi-dimensional co-evolution' strategy: explicitly maintaining and mutating a population of control flow graphs separate from the function bodies, which allows the system to escape the local optima imposed by a fixed human-designed harness. We must evaluate if this structural search approach can be integrated into AlgoEvo to automate our harness design.</details> | Zhe Zhao et.al. | Princeton University, Nanyang Technological University, City University of Hong Kong, University of Science and Technology of China, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) | arXiv.org | [2503.10721](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10721) | — |

Results show that while this context is crucial for smaller open-weights models (enabling Qwen-32B to slightly outperform GPT-4o on specific instances), it actually degrades the performance of GPT-4o compared to the baseline. The only takeaway for our AlgoEvo work is a confirmation that local model scaling requires verbose context injection, whereas frontier models may suffer from over-constrained prompts. This is an application paper with negligible algorithmic contribution.</details> | Thomas Bömer et.al. | TU Dortmund University, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology | arXiv.org | [2503.03350](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03350) | **[link](https://github.com/nico-koltermann/contextual-evolution-of-heuristics)** |

The authors demonstrate that a parent's own score is a poor predictor of its ability to evolve further; treating parents as 'bandit arms' based on their lineage statistics yields significantly better results on Bin Packing and TSP with fewer samples. While they fail to beat DeepMind's massive-scale Cap Set record, the methodological insight regarding 'offspring-aware' selection is statistically validated and immediately transferable to our evolutionary search frameworks.</details> | Zijie Chen et.al. | Westlake University, Zhejiang University, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China |  | [2412.20694](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20694) | **[link](https://github.com/zzjchen/QUBE_code)** |

The results are validated on a benchmark integral, demonstrating that STGP converges in ~30 generations compared to FunSearch's thousands when provided with the right primitives. **Key Takeaway:** A replicable workflow for sample efficiency: use the LLM to explore and identify relevant feature primitives (e.g., specific sums/counts), then lock those into a grammar for a cheaper, faster traditional GP search. This hybrid approach directly addresses our token-efficiency bottlenecks in AlgoEvo without discarding the LLM's creative exploration capabilities.</details> | Matt von Hippel et.al. | University of Copenhagen, University of Southern Denmark | Journal of High Energy Physics | [2502.05121](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05121) | — |

The results are credible and strong: on TSP, they find heuristics matching EoH's quality but running 16x faster (1.37s vs 22.4s) by effectively navigating the complexity-performance trade-off. The single most useful takeaway is the **AST-based dissimilarity metric** for population management; we should immediately steal this to prune semantically identical code in our evolutionary loops, thereby forcing exploration and improving sample efficiency.

They report superior results over ReEvo and FunSearch on Bin Packing and TSP, validated by proposed diversity metrics based on code embeddings. **Key Takeaway:** We should implement the hybrid tuning pattern: explicitly parsing LLM-generated code to extract constants and tuning them with a cheap numerical optimizer (rather than asking the LLM to tune parameters), and adopt batched reflections to reduce inference costs.</details> | Pham Vu Tuan Dat et.al. | George Mason University, Hanoi University of Science and Technology | arXiv.org | [2412.14995](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14995) | **[link](https://github.com/datphamvn/HSEvo)** |

The paper focuses heavily on full-stack engineering (Next.js, Chakra UI) rather than algorithmic novelty, and the 'evolution' appears to be trivial prompt parameter tuning rather than the structural code evolution we pursue.

The results are robust, beating top human teams on 5/8 historical contests using a generic evolutionary setup. The critical takeaway is the 'switching variable' technique: using a single evolved function to handle multiple distinct decision points (e.g., selecting a vehicle vs. selecting a route) by passing a state flag, rather than evolving multiple interacting functions. This validates that generalist models (Flash) are sufficient for high-end OR evolution without code-specific fine-tuning.

While they claim significant improvements over GP/GEP and DRL, the ablation study reveals only a marginal <1% improvement over the existing ReEvo framework on benchmark instances.

The results are strong and relevant: they outperform EoH (Evolution of Heuristics) and NCO baselines on TSP, CVRP, and Bin Packing with significantly higher sample efficiency (only ~100 evaluations). The single most useful takeaway is the 'Short-term Reflection' prompting strategy—explicitly asking the LLM to derive a mutation direction by comparing the logic of high-fitness vs. low-fitness parents—which we should immediately test in our AlgoEvo framework to reduce sample costs.

The empirical results are abysmal (2% on ARC test set), significantly underperforming even 2020 baselines (20%).

Additionally, they find that larger models (GPT-4) do not strictly guarantee better heuristic search performance compared to smaller, code-specialized models like CodeLlama-7B.</details> | Rui Zhang et.al. | City University of Hong Kong, Southern University of Science and Technology | the 18th International Conference on Parallel Problem Solving From Nature (PPSN 2024) | [2407.10873](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10873) | **[link](https://github.com/zhichao-lu/llm-eps)** |

The results are empirically strong, showing that evolved AFs generalize well to out-of-distribution functions and outperform standard baselines like EI and UCB. The most stealable insight is their 'few-shot' adaptation strategy, where a general-purpose heuristic is rapidly fine-tuned on a small set of target instances—a technique we should immediately test for our VRP heuristics.

While the application (Tensor Networks) is niche, the results outperform standard heuristics like TNGA and TNLS. The critical takeaway for us is the 'Knowledge Categorization' phase: they use the LLM to semantically cluster the population of generated algorithms to manage diversity and guide the 'Diversity Injection' step.

On Online Bin Packing, it claims to outperform DeepMind's FunSearch while using only ~2,000 LLM queries (vs FunSearch's millions), and achieves SOTA gaps on TSP and FSSP via Guided Local Search. The critical takeaway is the 'E2' prompt strategy: explicitly asking the LLM to extract common ideas from parent heuristics into a natural language 'thought' before generating code, which acts as a genetic Chain-of-Thought to stabilize mutation.

While the results are statistically negligible (single trials, ~0.8% gain on CIFAR-10), the EoT mechanism offers a specific, actionable prompt engineering technique: explicitly prompting the LLM to compare a successful elite individual against its original seed to extract 'reasoning' before applying mutations to new individuals. This serves as a lightweight, prompt-based memory/feedback mechanism that could immediately improve sample efficiency in our evolutionary search agents. The 'Character Role Play' (e.g., asking the LLM to act as 'Dr. MaGoo' for unorthodox ideas) is a gimmicky but potentially useful heuristic for maintaining population diversity.</details> | Clint Morris et.al. | Georgia Tech Research Institute | Annual Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation | [2403.11446](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11446) | **[link](https://github.com/clint-kristopher-morris/llm-guided-evolution)** |

The results are strong, showing generalization to unseen Brax control tasks and successful (though sometimes unstable) self-bootstrapping. The key takeaway for us is the SR-EAD loop as a mechanism for open-ended optimizer improvement, and their use of Perceiver cross-attention to handle variable population sizes—a technique we should immediately steal for our multi-agent memory architectures.</details> | Robert Tjarko Lange et.al. | Google DeepMind, TU Berlin | GECCO Companion | [2403.02985](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02985) | **[link](https://github.com/RobertTLange/evosax)** |

| 26/30 | **2026-01-05** | <details><summary>**Optimizing LLM Inference: Fluid-Guided Online Scheduling with Memory Constraints**</summary>This paper formulates LLM inference as a multi-stage stochastic scheduling problem, introducing 'Nested WAIT'—a threshold-based algorithm that handles unknown output lengths by letting prompts classify themselves as they survive into deeper decode segments. Unlike heuristic baselines (vLLM, Sarathi), they provide rigorous asymptotic optimality proofs and high-probability bounds against memory overflow, validated on A100 simulations. The key takeaway is the 'nested segment' mechanism: instead of predicting job size, structure the queue so short jobs exit early and long jobs naturally migrate to lower-priority/protected tiers, effectively decoupling the memory risk. We should immediately evaluate this threshold logic for our GPUSched formulations, as it likely outperforms our current predictive or FCFS approaches for handling KV cache growth.</details> | Ruicheng Ao et.al. | Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Peking University, Alibaba Group | — |
| 25/30 | **2026-02-07** | <details><summary>**A Two-Layer Framework for Joint Online Configuration Selection and Admission Control**</summary>The authors introduce a 'switching-aware' primal-dual framework for joint configuration selection (e.g., quantization, parallelism) and admission control, demonstrating that dynamically mixing configurations allows for higher resource utilization than any single fixed configuration. Results are rigorous, backed by $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bounds and experiments on Alibaba cluster traces where the method achieves ~97% competitive ratio (vs. ~85% for greedy). The key takeaway is the 'switching-aware fluid oracle' concept: our resource allocation models for LLM serving must optimize over the convex hull of configurations (mixing CPU-heavy and Mem-heavy setups) rather than searching for a single static optimum. We should adapt their saddle-point formulation for the GPUSched project to handle heterogeneous resource constraints more effectively.</details> | Owen Shen et.al. | Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University | — |
| 25/30 | **2026-02-03** | <details><summary>**3D-Learning: Diffusion-Augmented Distributionally Robust Decision-Focused Learning**</summary>Wen et al. introduce '3D-Learning,' a framework that replaces analytic ambiguity sets (Wasserstein/KL) in Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) with a diffusion model trained via PPO to generate worst-case scenarios. Applied to LLM resource provisioning, they claim ~40-50% regret reduction on OOD Azure traces compared to standard DRO, though training computational cost is high (6.8GB memory vs 35MB). The critical takeaway is the methodology of parameterizing the ambiguity set with a generative model to find 'realistic' adversarial edge cases that respect the data manifold, solving the support shift issue of KL-DRO. We should steal this 'generative ambiguity set' concept for benchmarking our heuristics in RobustMAS and AlgoEvo.</details> | Jiaqi Wen et.al. | University of Houston | **[link](https://github.com/CIGLAB-Houston/3DLearning.git)** |
| 25/30 | **2025-07-21** | <details><summary>**DHEvo: Data-Algorithm Based Heuristic Evolution for Generalizable MILP Solving**</summary>DHEvo introduces a 'data-algorithm co-evolution' framework that iteratively evolves heuristic code while simultaneously filtering the training instance set to retain only 'representative' instances (those where current heuristics perform well/stably). Empirical results on SCIP diving heuristics show it outperforms FunSearch and EoH by ~60% on Setcover while significantly reducing performance variance, validating the claim that dynamic data curation prevents overfitting. The key takeaway is the counter-intuitive curriculum strategy: rather than training on the hardest instances, filtering for instances with 'regular' feasible regions (high fitness) stabilizes the evolutionary search for code. We should immediately test this dynamic instance filtering in AlgoEvo to improve sample efficiency and generalization.</details> | Zhihao Zhang et.al. | Harbin Institute of Technology, Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab, Nanyang Technological University | — |
| 25/30 | **2025-03-05** | <details><summary>**Helix: Serving Large Language Models over Heterogeneous GPUs and Network via Max-Flow**</summary>Helix formulates distributed LLM serving on heterogeneous clusters as a max-flow problem, using MILP to optimize model placement and deriving a per-request weighted round-robin scheduler from the flow solution. Unlike standard static pipeline parallelism, it routes every request dynamically based on edge capacities, achieving up to 3.3x throughput gains over Swarm on mixed GPU clusters (L4/T4/A100). The results are rigorous, backed by both physical cluster experiments and high-fidelity simulations. The critical takeaway is the 'per-request pipeline' abstraction: decoupling request routing from static device assignment allows exact OR methods to maximize utilization of weaker hardware—a technique we should immediately evaluate for our GPUSched project.</details> | Yixuan Mei et.al. | Carnegie Mellon University | **[link](https://github.com/Thesys-lab/Helix-ASPLOS25)** |

| 21/30 | **2026-02-09** | <details><summary>**OSCAR: Optimization-Steered Agentic Planning for Composed Image Retrieval**</summary>Wang et al. formulate agentic tool-use planning not as a heuristic search (ReAct), but as a two-stage Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) problem that solves for the mathematically optimal trajectory (tool selection + set operations) on training data. These 'golden trajectories' are then used as retrieved in-context demonstrations to steer the VLM at inference time, achieving SOTA on CIR benchmarks with only 10% of training data. **Key Takeaway:** We can steal this 'Offline MIP $\to$ Online ICL' paradigm. Instead of relying on noisy online RL or expensive evolutionary loops to guide our AlgoEvo agents, we can solve MIPs on training instances to generate optimal reasoning traces, effectively 'solving' the prompt engineering problem via OR.</details> | Teng Wang et.al. | Shanghai Jiao Tong University, OPPO |  | [2602.08603](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08603) | **[link](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/OSCAR-3A55/README.md)** |
| 24/30 | **2026-02-09** | <details><summary>**Predicting Future Utility: Global Combinatorial Optimization for Task-Agnostic KV Cache Eviction**</summary>Tang et al. formulate KV cache eviction not as a heuristic filtering task, but as a global combinatorial optimization problem maximizing 'Oracle Importance' (future utility) across all attention heads. They solve this NP-hard problem efficiently by applying Isotonic Regression (via PAVA) to create a convex surrogate of the eviction loss, enabling an optimal greedy allocation strategy that is deployed via an offline-computed lookup table. Results are strong: they achieve 80% cache reduction on LongBench and RULER with minimal degradation, significantly outperforming dynamic heuristics like AdaKV. **Key Takeaway:** The decomposition of error into 'ranking error' vs. 'allocation error'—and solving the latter via convex-hull relaxation—is a powerful OR pattern we should apply to our own resource allocation and scheduling problems.</details> | Ziyao Tang et.al. | Baidu, Fudan University |  | [2602.08585](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08585) | — |

They report 1.2–1.8x throughput improvements and ~5x faster job completion times on A100 clusters compared to mLoRA, backed by realistic trace-driven experiments. For our GPUSched and resource allocation work, their hierarchical incremental grouping strategy serves as the state-of-the-art heuristic baseline we must outperform; additionally, their adaptive nano-batching (AIMD controller) is a transferable engineering trick for overlapping communication in distributed LLM workloads.</details> | Kevin Li et.al. | University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign |  | [2602.07263](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07263) | — |

| 24/30 | **2026-02-03** | <details><summary>**Large-Scale LLM Inference with Heterogeneous Workloads: Prefill-Decode Contention and Asymptotically Optimal Control**</summary>Lin et al. formulate LLM inference scheduling as a multiclass many-server queueing network, deriving a 'Gate-and-Route' policy from a steady-state fluid LP that explicitly manages prefill-decode contention. Calibrated on A100s, their approach proves that separating prefill admission (via occupancy tracking) from decode routing (work-conserving) eliminates decode backlogs and maximizes revenue. **Key Takeaway:** The decomposition of scheduling into 'static planning' (solving an LP for target occupancies) and 'dynamic control' (a simple gate tracking those targets) is a scalable alternative to online combinatorial optimization for your GPUSched work. It mathematically formalizes the intuition that prefill is the bottleneck and decode should be kept strictly critical but not backlogged.</details> | Ruihan Lin et.al. | The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology |  | [2602.02987](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02987) | — |

| 21/30 | **2026-02-03** | <details><summary>**PROBE: Co-Balancing Computation and Communication in MoE Inference via Real-Time Predictive Prefetching**</summary>PROBE optimizes MoE inference by using a distilled MLP to predict next-layer expert activation, enabling proactive load balancing and weight prefetching hidden behind the current layer's computation. The results are strong (1.3x speedup on 235B models) and demonstrate that control plane overheads can be fully masked. The critical takeaway for our `GPUSched` project is the **Lookahead Pipelining** architecture: it carves out a deterministic execution window where we could inject our own specialized solvers (e.g., fast ALNS or IP formulations) to outperform their basic greedy resource allocator. This transforms the stochastic serving problem into a short-horizon deterministic routing problem we are well-equipped to solve.</details> | Qianchao Zhu et.al. | Kling Infra, Kuaishou Technology |  | [2602.00509](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00509) | — |

| 8/30 | **2026-02-02** | <details><summary>**Distributed Hierarchical Machine Learning for Joint Resource Allocation and Slice Selection in In-Network Edge Systems**</summary>Rashid et al. decompose an edge resource allocation MINLP into three subproblems and train a DeepSets architecture to approximate the optimal solver's decisions. They introduce a 'slack-aware' decoder (adding a dummy output node to the softmax) to enforce inequality constraints where resource usage must be $\le$ capacity. While they claim an 86% speedup over Gurobi/Ipopt with a <6% optimality gap, the approach relies entirely on expensive offline label generation and offers no methodological novelty for our evolutionary search or LLM-based optimization tracks. The slack-node trick is a basic implementation detail, not a research advance.</details> | Sulaiman Muhammad Rashid et.al. | Chonnam National University | arXiv.org | [2511.13313](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13313) | — |

| 19/30 | **2026-02-01** | <details><summary>**SNIP: An Adaptive Mixed Precision Framework for Subbyte Large Language Model Training**</summary>Pan et al. introduce SNIP, a framework that periodically solves a Knapsack-style Integer Linear Program (ILP) to assign layer-wise precision (FP4/FP8) during training, minimizing a custom 'divergence' metric subject to FLOPs constraints. Results are simulated via fake quantization (proxy FLOPs) rather than wall-clock time on native hardware, but the method scales to 70B models and outperforms heuristic baselines. **Key Takeaway:** The design pattern of 'collect sensitivity stats -> solve lightweight ILP -> dynamic reconfiguration' is highly relevant for our work on optimizing LLM serving and agent compute budgets; it proves standard OR solvers are fast enough to operate within the runtime loop of high-performance AI systems.</details> | Yunjie Pan et.al. | University of Michigan, NTT Research, Inc., University of Massachusetts Amherst |  | [2602.01410](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01410) | **[link](https://github.com/pyjhzwh/SNIP)** |
| 22/30 | **2026-02-01** | <details><summary>**Predictive Scheduling for Efficient Inference-Time Reasoning in Large Language Models**</summary>Brown et al. propose a 'Predictive Scheduling' framework that trains lightweight predictors (MLP on hidden states or LoRA) to estimate required CoT length before generation, using a greedy algorithm to allocate tokens under a global budget. Results show a 7.9% accuracy gain on GSM8K over uniform batching, backed by a systematic layer-wise analysis. **The key takeaway for us is that middle transformer layers (12-17)—not the final layer—contain the highest signal-to-noise ratio for predicting reasoning difficulty.** We should immediately test extracting features from these layers for our AlgoEvo value functions to improve sample efficiency. While the greedy scheduling algorithm itself is standard OR, the application to internal model states for pre-run allocation is a valid efficiency win for our serving optimization work.</details> | Katrina Brown et.al. | Harvard University |  | [2602.01237](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01237) | **[link](https://aneeshers.github.io/predictive-scheduling/)** |

| 14/30 | **2026-02-01** | <details><summary>**SFMP: Fine-Grained, Hardware-Friendly and Search-Free Mixed-Precision Quantization for Large Language Models**</summary>SFMP introduces a search-free mixed-precision quantization framework that uses Fisher information to deterministically reorder weights into hardware-friendly blocks, processed by a unified LUT-based GEMM kernel. The results are empirically strong, outperforming search-based baselines (AMQ) in both accuracy and setup time, while demonstrating that lower bit-widths can actually increase inference speed on GPUs (unlike standard kernels). The key takeaway is the 'row-column reordering' heuristic which successfully clusters unstructured salience into structured blocks, effectively bypassing the need for the combinatorial optimization/evolutionary search we typically apply to such allocation problems. This is relevant for our 'LLM serving optimization' work as it alters the latency/memory trade-off curve we model.</details> | Xin Nie et.al. | Nankai University |  | [2602.01027](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01027) | **[link](https://github.com/Nkniexin/SFMP)** |

| 18/30 | **2026-01-30** | <details><summary>**Foundation Models for Logistics: Toward Certifiable, Conversational Planning Interfaces**</summary>Yang et al. introduce a neurosymbolic agent that translates natural language into PDDL goals, using a learned latent space to estimate 'intent uncertainty' (distance to class centroids) which gates downstream execution. They use this uncertainty signal to drive both Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and prompt optimization (TextGrad), achieving higher accuracy than GPT-5 on a lightweight model. **Takeaway:** The concept of deriving a 'probabilistic guarantee' from latent embeddings to serve as a cheap proxy reward or filter is a concrete technique we should test in AlgoEvo to reduce expensive evaluations. However, be skeptical of the topline results as they rely on a simplistic 3-class classification task rather than complex reasoning.</details> | Yunhao Yang et.al. | Neurosymbolic Intelligence, The University of Texas at Austin, University of Colorado Boulder | arXiv.org | [2507.11352](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11352) | — |

| 16/30 | **2026-01-29** | <details><summary>**DASH: Deterministic Attention Scheduling for High-throughput Reproducible LLM Training**</summary>Qiang et al. formulate the deterministic attention backward pass as a DAG scheduling problem, proposing a 'Shift Scheduling' strategy (cyclic tile assignment) that eliminates pipeline bubbles caused by serialized gradient accumulation. They demonstrate up to 1.28x speedup on H800 GPUs, effectively removing the performance penalty for reproducible training. The most useful takeaway is the 'Shift Scheduling' pattern—using cyclic offsets to naturally enforce conflict-free resource access without explicit locks—which is a transferable primitive for parallel resource allocation in our multi-agent systems. For us, this primarily serves as an infrastructure enabler: it allows us to run reproducible evolutionary baselines (AlgoEvo) without the usual 30%+ compute tax.</details> | Xinwei Qiang et.al. | ByteDance, Shanghai Jiao Tong University |  | [2601.21824](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21824) | **[link](https://github.com/SJTU-Liquid/deterministic-FA3)** |
| 10/30 | **2026-01-29** | <details><summary>**CORE:Toward Ubiquitous 6G Intelligence Through Collaborative Orchestration of Large Language Model Agents Over Hierarchical Edge**</summary>Yu et al. propose CORE, a framework for distributing LLM agents across edge and cloud devices using a 'Role Affinity Scheduling' algorithm, which is essentially a variant of the Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time (HEFT) heuristic. They claim improved latency and task completion over ReAct and CrewAI in a fire detection scenario, though the evaluation relies on a limited set of 300 instructions without deep statistical rigor. The primary takeaway is a practical engineering trick: using an offline Digital Twin to pre-train a 'scheduling policy lookup table' to avoid expensive online simulations during inference. For our work on rigorous GPU scheduling and evolutionary search, this offers no new algorithmic insights.</details> | Zitong Yu et.al. | Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications | IEEE Communications Magazine | [2601.21822](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21822) | — |

The results are simulation-based and show improvements over weak baselines like Round Robin, but the rigorous modeling of service dependencies is relevant. The key takeaway is their use of **Effective Capacity theory** to analytically map stochastic processing times into deterministic constraints within the optimization loop—a specific formulation trick we should steal for handling variance in our own stochastic MAS and LLM serving optimization models.</details> | Juan Zhu et.al. | The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology |  | [2601.19563](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19563) | — |

Results are analytical and simulation-based, highlighting that network densification requires proportional frequency reuse to be cost-effective. While the rigorous handling of tail-latency constraints via M/D/1 queueing is competent, the heavy reliance on wireless channel modeling (fading, interference, base station geometry) makes this irrelevant for our work on LLM evolutionary search or cluster-level GPU scheduling.</details> | Jaume Anguera Peris et.al. | KTH Royal Institute of Technology |  | [2601.16848](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16848) | — |

| 8/30 | **2026-01-18** | <details><summary>**Cross-reality Location Privacy Protection in 6G-enabled Vehicular Metaverses: An LLM-enhanced Hybrid Generative Diffusion Model-based Approach**</summary>The authors propose LHDPPO, a reinforcement learning framework that uses an LLM to iteratively refine reward functions and diffusion models to generate hybrid actions for vehicular privacy. While the concept of an 'LLM-driven reward design loop' aligns with our interests in automated algorithm design, the implementation is standard and the empirical validation is trivial, relying on a simulation with only 5 vehicles. The results are likely overfitted to this micro-scale scenario and offer no evidence of scalability for the large-scale routing or multi-agent problems we study. We can safely ignore this as a repackaging of known techniques.</details> | Xiaofeng Luo et.al. | Nanyang Technological University, University of Manitoba, Sungkyunkwan University, Guangdong University of Technology | arXiv.org | [2601.12311](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12311) | — |

Results show significant energy savings on ImageNet simulations, though the setup is heavily tied to wireless channel modeling (Rayleigh fading).

Unlike heuristic baselines (vLLM, Sarathi), they provide rigorous asymptotic optimality proofs and high-probability bounds against memory overflow, validated on A100 simulations. The key takeaway is the 'nested segment' mechanism: instead of predicting job size, structure the queue so short jobs exit early and long jobs naturally migrate to lower-priority/protected tiers, effectively decoupling the memory risk.

The results demonstrate that solving a lightweight ILP per batch adds negligible latency (15%) while achieving Pareto-optimal quality/cost trade-offs compared to fixed allocation. **Takeaway:** We should steal the 'Scorer + ILP' pattern for our AlgoEvo and LLM serving work—specifically to dynamically allocate 'think time' or evolutionary generations based on predicted marginal utility, rather than using static budgets.</details> | Yan Li et.al. | Tsinghua University, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shanghai AI Laboratory, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Tongji University | arXiv.org | [2505.17011](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17011) | **[link](https://github.com/VisionXLab/AdapTok)** |

They validate this on a self-driving dataset, demonstrating that this 'guided' approach outperforms standard DRL in accuracy and is significantly faster than exhaustive BO. The useful takeaway is the architectural pattern of using a sample-efficient surrogate (BO) to filter and label actions for a fast neural policy in an online setting—essentially distilling an expensive search into a heuristic.

Results are sobering: SOTA models like GPT-4 and fine-tuned OR-LLMs drop from ~90% accuracy on existing toy benchmarks to ~18% here, failing primarily on structural consistency and index handling at scale. For us, the key takeaway is their "Loop-Based Structural Scaffold" taxonomy—a method to compress massive industrial formulations into compact LLM prompts via model-data separation. This is a mandatory read for our OR-Bench project, as it demonstrates that current evaluations are effectively measuring overfitting to toy problems rather than genuine modeling capability.</details> | Zhong Li et.al. | Peking University, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., Great Bay University | **[link](https://github.com/optsuite/MIPLIB-NL)** |

They rigorously show that standard statistical distance metrics often misalign with decision quality—a distribution can be statistically far from ground truth yet yield near-optimal decisions. The key actionable insight is that 'persona-sampling' (prompting the LLM to adopt specific demographics) significantly improves the aggregate distribution's utility for optimization, even if the LLM fails to simulate individual personas accurately.

It achieves ~72% pass@1 across five benchmarks, outperforming Chain-of-Experts and fine-tuned models like LLMOPT without task-specific training. The key takeaway is their **structured revision tip mechanism**: upon execution failure, the agent generates a JSON object explicitly isolating the `error_statement`, `incorrect_code_snippet`, and `correct_code_snippet`, which serves as a precise memory artifact for subsequent retries. This structured reflection pattern is superior to raw error logs and could be immediately adopted in our own code generation pipelines.</details> | Yifan Shi et.al. | Xi'an Jiaotong University, Northwestern Polytechnical University | — |

They introduce a rigorous data synthesis pipeline using 'scenario trees' to map qualitative descriptions (e.g., 'heatwave') to quantitative parameter deltas, and define structural extensions (e.g., adding security constraints) as modular patches. Results are sobering: SOTA models (GPT-4, Claude 3.5) score 0% on the hardest level (semantic inference + structural change), though SFT recovers ~11-35%. **Key Takeaway:** We should steal their 'Base + Delta' synthesis approach for our VRP variant generation and OR-Bench work; it allows for scalable, physically valid data generation without requiring an LLM to hallucinate full solvers, and effectively benchmarks 'ambiguity' handling.</details> | Chao Shen et.al. |  | — |

Results are purely theoretical and simulation-based, showing that finetuning scales with the number of tasks ($N$) to correct pretraining bias. The single most stealable insight is the use of **Stein's identity to construct a differentiable, label-free loss function**, allowing the model to adapt to real data without ground-truth labels—a technique potentially transferable to unsupervised adaptation in our stochastic OR projects.

They report 17-57% gap reductions on TSPLIB and JSSP compared to Gurobi defaults, backed by strong ablation studies on the evolutionary operators. **Key Takeaway:** The reliance on 'acceleration cuts'—constraints verified empirically on small datasets rather than formally proven—bypasses the bottleneck of automated theorem proving while still delivering valid speedups. We should immediately adopt their 'LP separation' check as a cheap, high-signal reward for our own evolutionary search loops.</details> | M.

The key innovation is using the simulator to validate the optimizer's results in a closed loop, detecting logical errors without ground truth—a technique that beats fine-tuned models like SIRL by up to 28%. The most stealable insight is this asymmetric validation: imperative Python simulation is often less error-prone than declarative constraint formulation, making it a robust 'critic' for generated solvers. This is immediately applicable to our OR-Bench and AlgoEvo projects for generating reliable reward signals.</details> | Yang Song et.al. | Carnegie Mellon University, C3 AI | — |

Unlike standard discriminative PRMs that score steps in isolation, their GenPRM generates a reasoning trace to evaluate the full trajectory's logic before assigning credit, addressing the interdependency of OR constraints. They align the policy using **Weighted DPO**, where preference weights are derived from the GenPRM's process scores. They claim to beat GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 on 6 OR benchmarks (e.g., NL4Opt, MAMO) with an 8B model. **Key Takeaway:** We should test **Generative PRMs** immediately for AlgoEvo; asking the critic to 'explain then score' (generative) rather than just 'score' (discriminative) likely fixes the credit assignment noise in our long-horizon search.</details> | Chenyu Zhou et.al. | Shanghai Jiao Tong University | — |

By removing the KL penalty from the reasoning (CoT) section while retaining it for the code generation section, they balance exploration with syntactic stability, achieving SOTA on OptMATH and IndustryOR against OpenAI-o3 and DeepSeek-R1. The critical takeaway for us is the Partial KL strategy: it allows the model to 'think' freely outside the reference distribution while adhering to strict coding standards—a technique we should immediately test in AlgoEvo. Furthermore, their method of parsing .lp files to extract structural features (variable counts, constraint types) for 'instance-enhanced self-consistency' provides a much richer signal than our current binary success/failure metrics.</details> | Yitian Chen et.al. | Stanford University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, The University of Hong Kong, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, Cardinal Operations | **[link](https://github.com/Cardinal-Operations/SIRL)** |

They prove that for 'symmetric decomposable' graphs, this method is guaranteed to detect equivalence correctly, achieving 100% consistency and running in seconds compared to hours for solver-based checks on hard MIPLIB instances. The critical takeaway is the shift from execution-based to **structural evaluation**: we can validate model logic via graph topology ($O(k(m+n)^2)$) without incurring the cost of solving NP-hard problems. This is immediately actionable for our OR benchmarking pipelines and could serve as a rapid 'pre-solve' filter in our evolutionary search loops to reject structurally invalid candidates instantly.</details> | Zhuohan Wang et.al. | The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data, Shenzhen International Center for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, Shenzhen Loop Area Institute | — |

They achieve state-of-the-art accuracy (47.2% vs 22.4% baseline) on a new, complex benchmark (ORCOpt-Bench) by using a multi-agent pipeline that retrieves and adapts constraint templates. The key takeaway is the 'Mapper' agent's paradigm selection logic, which prevents common formulation errors in VRPs and scheduling; we should evaluate CIR as a structured mutation space for AlgoEvo to replace brittle code evolution. The new benchmark is immediately relevant for our OR-Bench evaluation suite.</details> | Zhongyuan Lyu et.al. | The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, InfiX.ai |  | [2602.02029](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02029) | — |

While the problem formulation of 'Constraint Injection' (editing LP files directly rather than regenerating from scratch) is a valid task for our OR agents, their execution relies entirely on standard supervised fine-tuning. The results are weak: their variable pruning module fails to scale, with F1 scores dropping to near zero on LP files exceeding 1,500 lines due to context limitations. This is an application paper with no transferable algorithmic insights for our evolutionary search work.</details> | Yiliu He et.al. | Southeast University |  | [2602.01082](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01082) | — |

They demonstrate that this approach matches the accuracy of expensive multi-agent systems (like Chain-of-Experts) while being significantly faster and cheaper. The immediate takeaways for us are the **StochasticOR benchmark** (which we should adopt for RobustMAS) and the technique of **injecting explicit BNF grammars** into prompts to enforce syntax in evolutionary search without fine-tuning. The 'literate modeling' approach—embedding reasoning as comments directly next to code constraints—is also a clever memory mechanism we could steal for AlgoEvo.</details> | Roberto Rossi et.al. | University of Edinburgh, University College Cork |  | [2601.17670](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17670) | **[link](https://gwr3n.github.io/rhetor/)** |
| 23/30 | **2026-01-17** | <details><summary>**Automated Optimization Modeling via a Localizable Error-Driven Perspective**</summary>This paper introduces MIND, a framework for automated optimization modeling that combines error-driven data synthesis with a novel post-training method called DFPO. Instead of standard RLVR which suffers from sparse rewards on hard problems, DFPO uses a teacher model to minimally correct the student's *failed* rollouts, converting them into on-policy(ish) positive samples for SFT/RL. Results show a 7B model outperforming GPT-4 on IndustryOR and OptMATH benchmarks. **Key Takeaway:** We should steal the DFPO mechanism for AlgoEvo: rather than wasting failed evolutionary samples, use a stronger model (or oracle) to fix the code and feed it back as a reward signal, drastically improving sample efficiency in our RL loops.</details> | Weiting Liu et.al. | Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab, Fudan University, University of Science and Technology of China |  | [2602.11164](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11164) | — |

Results show a jump from ~0% to ~76% logic consistency, confirming that base models hallucinate SimPy mechanics without targeted training. The most useful takeaway is the 'Stage II' masked completion strategy: explicitly masking functional logic blocks (e.g., 'service interruption logic') during training to force the model to learn internal library semantics rather than just surface-level completion. This technique could be transferable if our AlgoEvo agents struggle with hallucinating internal APIs, but otherwise, the paper is a niche engineering application.</details> | Jun-Qi Chen et.al. | Renmin University of China, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China | arXiv.org | [2601.06543](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06543) | — |

The results are rigorous and backed by solver verification. **Key Takeaway:** The 'Constraint Augmentation' analysis reveals a critical bottleneck: LLM performance drops sharply when simple, non-canonical constraints are added to standard problems, indicating a reliance on memorized templates rather than logical composition. This is a direct competitor/reference for our OR-Bench work and suggests we need to stress-test our AlgoEvo formulations against constraint perturbations.</details> | Yitian Chen et.al. | University of Chicago, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, Cardinal Operations |  | [2601.19924](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19924) | **[link](https://github.com/Cardinal-Operations/OPTEngine)** |

The authors claim high success rates (~90% on NL4Opt) using GPT-5.1, employing a 'Feasibility Domain Correction' loop that iteratively adjusts initial points or relaxation strategies when solvers fail. While the results are strong, the methodology is essentially 'textbook relaxation via prompting'—useful for our symbolic OR benchmarking baseline, but it provides no new insights for algorithmic discovery or evolutionary search.</details> | Xinyue Peng et.al. | Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Zhejiang University, Southeast University | arXiv.org | [2601.04789](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04789) | — |

By generating multiple distinct algorithm types and pooling their results, they achieve performance competitive with state-of-the-art heuristics. The primary takeaway is empirical confirmation that LLM-generated algorithm portfolios provide better Pareto coverage than single heuristics, but the underlying 'agent' framework is trivial compared to our evolutionary search methods. This is an application paper with no transferable methodological insights for our core research.</details> | Simon Paquette-Greenbaum et.al. | McGill University | arXiv.org | [2601.00770](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00770) | — |

They generate synthetic training data and filter it by checking if the generated code ranks historical data instances similarly to how an LLM 'judge' ranks them based on the text requirements. Results show 7B models outperforming GPT-4o on antenna design tasks, validated by actual simulation. **Key Takeaway:** We can replace expensive ground-truth evaluations in our process reward models by checking consistency between generated code outputs and LLM-predicted rankings on cached historical data—a direct method to improve sample efficiency in AlgoEvo.</details> | Yuchen Li et.al. | Xidian University, Victoria University of Wellington, Westlake University | arXiv.org | [2512.18682](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18682) | — |

They find that while models fail to explicitly calculate features like graph density via prompting, a classifier trained on their max-pooled hidden states matches the performance of handcrafted features for algorithm selection. **Takeaway:** This confirms that LLM latent spaces hold rich structural signals useful for Process Reward Models or state representations in AlgoEvo, even when the model's explicit reasoning fails. However, since performance is only 'comparable' to cheap handcrafted features but computationally expensive, we should only leverage this for problems where manual feature engineering is impossible.</details> | Francesca Da Ros et.al. | University of Udine, Italy | arXiv.org | [2512.13374](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13374) | **[link](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17913884)** |

The results show that this structured approach allows a 27B model to rival GPT-4o on simple tasks, though the benchmarks (e.g., grid-world drone delivery, trivial wireless scheduling) are toy-scale and the RL application is sometimes forced. The primary takeaway is the specific decomposition schema for symbolic modeling: we should steal their granular extraction pipeline (Parameters -> Objectives -> Variables -> Constraints) to improve the reliability of our automated problem instantiation in OR-Bench and AlgoEvo without relying solely on expensive frontier models.</details> | Hong Je-Gal et.al. | Sejong University | arXiv.org | [2512.11270](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11270) | — |
| 22/30 | **2025-11-20** | <details><summary>**An Agent-Based Framework for the Automatic Validation of Mathematical Optimization Models**</summary>Zadorojniy et al. introduce a multi-agent framework for validating LLM-generated optimization models by generating a test suite and verifying the suite's quality via mutation testing (ensuring tests detect deliberate errors injected into the model). On 100 NLP4LP instances, they achieve a 76% mutation kill ratio and successfully classify external models where simple objective value comparisons fail. The critical takeaway is the 'bootstrapped validation' workflow: using mutation analysis to validate the generated unit tests themselves before using them to score the model. We should steal this mutation-based verification loop to create a robust, ground-truth-free fitness signal for our evolutionary search and OR benchmarking pipelines.</details> | Alexander Zadorojniy et.al. | IBM Research | arXiv.org | [2511.16383](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16383) | — |
| 9/30 | **2025-11-13** | <details><summary>**LM4Opt-RA: A Multi-Candidate LLM Framework with Structured Ranking for Automating Network Resource Allocation**</summary>Ahmed et al. propose a framework for translating natural language to LP/MILP formulations using three prompt variations (Direct, Few-shot, CoT) followed by a pairwise LLM ranking step. They introduce a small dataset (NL4RA, 50 instances) and an LLM-based evaluation metric (LAME) to replace BLEU/ROUGE. The methodology is elementary prompt engineering, and the dataset scale is too small to be useful for our large-scale VRP or scheduling work. The only minor takeaway is their confirmation that lexical metrics fail for OR formulations, validating the need for semantic evaluation, but their proposed solution is a standard LLM-judge wrapper.</details> | Tasnim Ahmed et.al. | Queen’s University | arXiv.org | [2512.00039](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00039) | — |
| 11/30 | **2025-11-04** | <details><summary>**An LLM-powered MILP modelling engine for workforce scheduling guided by expert knowledge**</summary>Li et al. propose SMILO, a framework that restricts LLMs to extracting parameters into a manually defined 'Modelling Graph,' using deterministic templates to assemble MILP code for workforce scheduling. While they achieve 90% accuracy on a small custom dataset of 20 instances, the method is essentially a rigid expert system that sacrifices generalization for reliability. The primary takeaway is the detailed error analysis of GPT-4o on scheduling constraints (e.g., failing to infer implicit weekend rules), which we could incorporate into our OR-Bench failure taxonomy. However, the reliance on domain-specific manual graph construction makes this approach non-scalable for our automated discovery work.</details> | Qingyang Li et.al. | The University of Melbourne, Deakin University |  | [2511.02364](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02364) | — |

While the benchmarks (inventory, queuing) are simple and the causal inference step seems fragile, the core innovation of **trajectory-based reasoning** is highly transferable. We can steal this mechanism for AlgoEvo: instead of blind evolution, our planner agent should consume the optimization trajectory to dynamically swap operators or restart populations when stagnation is detected, effectively using the LLM as a process reward model.</details> | Haoting Zhang et.al. | Columbia, UC Berkeley, Amazon | arXiv.org | [2511.00685](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00685) | — |
| 25/30 | **2025-10-31** | <details><summary>**ORGEval: Graph-Theoretic Evaluation of LLMs in Optimization Modeling**</summary>Wang et al. propose ORGEval, a framework that evaluates LLM-generated optimization models by converting them into bipartite graphs and using the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test to detect isomorphism with a ground truth, rather than solving the instances. They prove that for 'symmetric decomposable' graphs, this method is guaranteed to detect equivalence correctly, achieving 100% consistency and running in seconds compared to hours for solver-based checks on hard MIPLIB instances. The critical takeaway is the shift from execution-based to **structural evaluation**: we can validate model logic via graph topology ($O(k(m+n)^2)$) without incurring the cost of solving NP-hard problems. This is immediately actionable for our OR benchmarking pipelines and could serve as a rapid 'pre-solve' filter in our evolutionary search loops to reject structurally invalid candidates instantly.</details> | Zhuohan Wang et.al. | The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data, Shenzhen International Center for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, Shenzhen Loop Area Institute | arXiv.org | [2510.27610](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27610) | — |

On OOD benchmarks like OptiBench, it beats fine-tuned models (ORLM) by ~13% and shows consistent scaling with data size. **Key Takeaway:** The specific mechanism of diagnosing 'unretrieved' vs. 'negative' tasks to rewrite retrieval triggers is a transferable technique for our AlgoEvo memory; it solves the problem of heuristic misapplication in long-term search. We should implement this 'condition refinement' loop immediately to improve our multi-agent memory systems.</details> | Minwei Kong et.al. | Massachusetts Institute of Technology, London School of Economics and Political Science, University of Florida, Northeastern University, Singapore Management University, Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology | arXiv.org | [2510.18428](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18428) | **[link](https://github.com/Minw913/AlphaOPT)** |

The results appear robust, showing ~10% gains on complex datasets, though inference cost is high. **The critical takeaway for us is the 'Prompt Backpropagation' mechanism:** instead of just updating numerical values, they propagate textual error analysis from leaf nodes back up the tree to dynamically modify the prompts of parent nodes, effectively creating 'short-term memory' for the search. We should immediately test this technique in AlgoEvo to prevent the recurrence of failed code patterns during mutation steps. Additionally, their use of semantic entropy to down-weight uncertain rewards in MCTS is a practical solution to the noisy evaluation problem we face in process reward models.</details> | Dong Li et.al. | NEC Labs America, Baylor University, University of Texas at Dallas, Augusta University, Southern Illinois University | arXiv.org | [2510.16916](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16916) | — |

On 40 benchmark instances, it achieves 73% end-to-end success compared to <15% for one-shot LLMs and Pyomo baselines, demonstrating that structural decomposition is essential for handling complex nested terms. The key takeaway is the 'Structural Policy': rather than letting the LLM plan the reformulation order, they enforce a deterministic bottom-up traversal (linearizing children before parents). We should steal this hybrid approach—using deterministic graph traversal to orchestrate LLM manipulation steps—to improve reliability in our symbolic modeling and EvoCut pipelines.</details> | Paul-Niklas Ken Kandora et.al. | Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Reutlingen University | arXiv.org | [2510.15969](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15969) | — |

Results are strong and verified: a 4B model matches DeepSeek-R1 (671B) on OR benchmarks, specifically fixing the 'Code Utilization Distrust' we see in our own agents. The key takeaway is the 'Intervener' loop: instead of discarding failed traces, they repair them with hints to create a 'golden' reasoning dataset that preserves the 'thinking' process while enforcing tool use. This is a direct, actionable method for improving our AlgoEvo agents' reliability in generating executable heuristics without massive human annotation.</details> | Zhengyang Tang et.al. | Qwen Team, Alibaba Inc., The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, Shenzhen Loop Area Institute (SLAI) | arXiv.org | [2510.04204](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04204) | **[link](https://github.com/tangzhy/STORM)** |

Unlike standard prompting, they implement an automated DSL adaptation algorithm using non-parametric modeling (DPMM) and Expectation-Maximization to learn the syntax and semantics of the intermediate representation from data, which is then verified via a Pushdown Automaton. While the experiments rely on synthetic data augmented from standard benchmarks (a weakness), the methodology for **automatically deriving the intermediate representation** rather than hand-coding it is a transferable insight.

While they claim this is a 'Foundation Model,' the methodology appears to require retraining for every new map (e.g., separate models for Chengdu vs. Berkeley), rendering it a glorified, expensive map index rather than a generalizable solver. The only potentially transferable insight is the 'insertion-based reconstruction' curriculum for learning path connectivity, but the lack of cross-graph generalization makes this irrelevant for our dynamic VRP work.</details> | Yunhao Liang et.al. | University of California, Berkeley, The University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen Institute of Research and Innovation | arXiv.org | [2509.24256](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24256) | **[link](https://github.com/jettbrains/-L-)** |

Unlike standard discriminative PRMs that score steps in isolation, their GenPRM generates a reasoning trace to evaluate the full trajectory's logic before assigning credit, addressing the interdependency of OR constraints. They align the policy using **Weighted DPO**, where preference weights are derived from the GenPRM's process scores. They claim to beat GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 on 6 OR benchmarks (e.g., NL4Opt, MAMO) with an 8B model. **Key Takeaway:** We should test **Generative PRMs** immediately for AlgoEvo; asking the critic to 'explain then score' (generative) rather than just 'score' (discriminative) likely fixes the credit assignment noise in our long-horizon search.</details> | Chenyu Zhou et.al. | Shanghai Jiao Tong University | arXiv.org | [2509.22558](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22558) | — |

They introduce a 'class-based error analysis' where the model classifies a problem (e.g., TSP) and retrieves specific, expert-written hints to avoid common pitfalls, boosting accuracy by ~20%. **Takeaway:** We must immediately replace our benchmark versions with their cleaned sets for the OR-Bench project.

While they outperform baselines on simple tasks, the model collapses on complex industry problems (14% accuracy), confirming that basic SFT is insufficient for the scale of problems we target. The only useful takeaway is their data generation pipeline—sampling parameters first, then wrapping them in text to ensure ground-truth validity—which is a clean pattern we could adapt for generating grounded test cases in OR-Bench.

Their experiments on a new dataset (OptU) convincingly demonstrate that standard LLM-generated deterministic models suffer from the 'optimizer's curse,' achieving only ~27% out-of-sample feasibility, whereas their robust approach achieves >70%. The critical takeaway for us is to **stop asking LLMs to derive mathematical duals or robust counterparts**; instead, we should train them to use high-level DSLs (like RSOME) that handle the duality internally. This is an immediate action item for our RobustMAS project to ensure generated solutions are actually executable in stochastic environments.</details> | WenZhuo Zhu et.al. | Zhejiang University, University of Toronto, Peking University | arXiv.org | [2511.11576](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11576) | **[link](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-for-data-driven-optimization-problems-9528)** |

While they outperform general reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and claim to beat Gurobi under strict 11s time limits, the method is an inefficient form of imitation learning that fails to scale or match the specialized heuristics it mimics. The only technical nugget is their specific reward shaping for GRPO to balance feasibility and optimality, but this does not redeem the fundamental flaw of using autoregressive text generation as a solver for large-scale OR.

Results on 110 TEXT2ZINC instances show a modest improvement over CoT (57% vs 52% execution rate with o3-mini), though the sample size is small and lacks statistical rigor.

They claim a 38% runtime reduction over Gurobi on large-scale Capacitated Facility Location Problems (CFLP), though this benefit likely stems from the classical Benders method rather than the LLM integration. The most interesting aspect is the attempt to automate the 'constraint-to-penalty' tuning for QUBO, but the system's failure to correctly formulate TSP (producing non-quadratic terms) reveals significant fragility.

They introduce a 'Differential Attention' mechanism in the critic that subtracts attention maps to filter noise, enabling scalability to 100 agents where standard baselines fail. **Takeaway:** We should steal the Differential Attention architecture for our multi-agent critics to handle irrelevant interactions in large-scale optimization. The workflow of using LLMs to write the *solver* (generating reliable synthetic data) rather than the *solution* is a transferable strategy for bootstrapping RL in our OR domains.</details> | C.

Their key contribution is 'DualReflect,' a synthetic data pipeline that combines Forward Generation (Problem→Code) for diversity with Backward Generation (Code→Problem) for correctness. **Takeaway:** We should steal the Backward Generation approach for AlgoEvo: instead of relying on noisy forward generation, we can take valid heuristics/OR code (which we have in abundance) and reverse-engineer problem descriptions to create massive, verifiable synthetic datasets for fine-tuning our code generation models. The paper proves this method is superior for 'cold-starting' small models in data-scarce domains.</details> | Chenyu Zhou et.al. | University of Chicago, Cornell University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, Cardinal Operations | arXiv.org | [2507.11737](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11737) | — |

By partitioning the population into ranked subsets and sampling pairs with a guaranteed quality gap (skipping adjacent tiers), they ensure training signals are both clear and diverse. Empirically, they show that a fine-tuned Llama-3.2-1B matches the performance of a base Llama-3.1-8B on ASP and CVRP tasks, effectively compressing the search capability into a much cheaper model. We should implement this sampling strategy to recycle our AlgoEvo run logs into specialized 'mutator' models, potentially allowing us to downscale to 1B/3B models for the inner search loop without losing quality.</details> | Fei Liu et.al. | City University of Hong Kong | arXiv.org | [2507.10614](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10614) | — |

The results highlight a critical failure mode: models implemented inconsistent simulation environments for complex problems (e.g., IronOre), rendering zero-shot results incomparable. The primary takeaway is that Claude 3.5 Sonnet appears to be a superior backend for code-based heuristic generation than o1, which defaults to naive grid search. We should consider incorporating their stochastic problem set into OR-Bench, but the paper offers no methodological advances for our evolutionary search frameworks.</details> | Akshit Kumar et.al. | Columbia University | Online World Conference on Soft Computing in Industrial Applications | [2506.23924](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23924) | **[link](https://github.com/AkshitKumar/simopt-llm-evals)** |

While their optimality gaps (~12%) trail behind state-of-the-art CP solvers (~1.5%), the ablation study confirms that their reflection mechanism significantly improves Pareto front diversity (Hypervolume). **The killer feature is the phenotypic clustering step:** instead of reflecting on a random or elitist subset, they group solutions by trade-offs (e.g., 'low makespan' vs 'balanced') to generate targeted prompts. We should implement this clustering-based context construction in AlgoEvo to improve diversity maintenance in multi-objective search without exploding token costs.</details> | Diego Forni'es-Tabuenca et.al. | Vicomtech Foundation, University of the Basque Country, Universidad EAFIT, HiTZ Basque Center for Language Technology | arXiv.org | [2506.07759](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07759) | — |

Results are backed by extensive experiments showing that SOTA LLMs saturate at ~60% of expert performance and, significantly, that existing evolutionary frameworks (ReEvo, EoH) perform *worse* than simple prompting on these large-context tasks (300+ lines of code). The key takeaway is the failure mode of current evolutionary methods: they cannot handle the context fragmentation and feedback integration required for complex heuristic design. We should immediately adopt this benchmark to demonstrate AlgoEvo's superiority, as the current baselines are weak and the problem set aligns perfectly with our focus.</details> | Hongzheng Chen et.al. | Cornell University, Harvard University, NVIDIA | arXiv.org | [2506.07972](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07972) | **[link](https://github.com/cornell-zhang/heurigym)** |

The results are rigorous and highlight a critical failure mode: LLMs overfit to the specific data values in the prompt's example instance, causing a ~30% performance drop when evaluated on hidden instances (Multi-Instance Accuracy). Crucially for our pipeline design, they find that Retrieval-Augmented In-Context Learning (RAICL) is ineffective or harmful compared to simply including library documentation in the system prompt. We should adopt their 'Multi-Instance Accuracy' metric immediately for OR-Bench and switch any MiniZinc generation efforts to Python-based frameworks like CPMpy or OR-Tools, which LLMs handle much better.</details> | Kostis Michailidis et.al. | KU Leuven, University of Western Macedonia | ECAI25) | [2506.06052](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06052) | **[link](https://github.com/kostis-init/CP-Bench)** |

They claim ~15% improvement over Chain-of-Experts on NL4Opt and their own ComplexOR dataset, though the latter contains only 37 instances, making the statistical significance questionable. The primary takeaway is the 'counterfactual' error message generation strategy—inverting the validation check to suggest specific constraint modifications—which we could adapt for better error signals in our code agents. This is directly relevant to our OR-Bench work but offers little for our core evolutionary search algorithms.</details> | Zhiyuan Wang et.al. | ETH Zurich, Tsinghua University, Sun Yat-sen University, Lenovo Research, Peng Cheng Laboratory | Proceedings of the 63rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 6: Industry Track) | [2506.01326](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01326) | **[link](https://github.com/XiaoAI1989/ORMind)** |

Results show that even strong LLMs often fail (<50% accuracy) and, crucially, that standard execution-based evaluation (checking objective values) produces frequent false positives by missing errors in redundant constraints. The primary takeaway for us is the CGED methodology: a robust way to score symbolic OR model generation that captures structural validity better than execution alone, which we could steal for our benchmarking and evolutionary search fitness functions.</details> | Michael Klamkin et.al. | Georgia Institute of Technology | arXiv.org | [2505.21775](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21775) | — |

The agent parses partner messages to update a partial graph and calls the solver to generate the next move. However, the evaluation is restricted to 6-node graphs, which is computationally trivial and offers no evidence of scalability or robustness for real-world OR problems. While the 'split-knowledge' game setup conceptually aligns with our multi-agent debate interests, the methodology is rudimentary tool-use rather than a fundamental advance in MAS optimization.</details> | Isidora Jeknic et.al. | Saarland University | arXiv.org | [2505.15490](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15490) | **[link](https://github.com/coli-saar/collaborative-problem-solving)** |

By removing the KL penalty from the reasoning (CoT) section while retaining it for the code generation section, they balance exploration with syntactic stability, achieving SOTA on OptMATH and IndustryOR against OpenAI-o3 and DeepSeek-R1. The critical takeaway for us is the Partial KL strategy: it allows the model to 'think' freely outside the reference distribution while adhering to strict coding standards—a technique we should immediately test in AlgoEvo. Furthermore, their method of parsing .lp files to extract structural features (variable counts, constraint types) for 'instance-enhanced self-consistency' provides a much richer signal than our current binary success/failure metrics.</details> | Yitian Chen et.al. | Stanford University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, The University of Hong Kong, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, Cardinal Operations | arXiv.org | [2505.11792](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11792) | **[link](https://github.com/Cardinal-Operations/SIRL)** |

Tested on large-scale Huawei/Azure VM traces, it achieves a 96.9% competitive ratio against Gurobi, significantly outperforming Deep RL (SchedRL) by ~11% in dynamic scenarios. **Key Insight:** Instead of evolving a single robust heuristic (which often fails in non-stationary environments), explicitly evolve a *portfolio* of specialized heuristics and a separate *selector* function. This SMDP-based decomposition is a concrete architectural pattern we should adopt in AlgoEvo to handle diverse problem instances and non-stationary distributions effectively.</details> | Jiehao Wu et.al. | Shanghai Jiao Tong University, East China Normal University, Tongji University | arXiv.org | [2505.10117](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10117) | **[link](https://github.com/jettbrains/-L-)** |

The results are empirically solid, showing a ~50% time reduction with <2.5% optimality gap, outperforming standard cutting plane baselines on NYC taxi data. **Key Takeaway:** We should adapt their 'Small-Sample Guided Optimization' strategy—specifically using LLMs to infer *variable fixing constraints* from elite archive solutions—to accelerate the inner solvers in our AlgoEvo and EvoCut pipelines. This offers a concrete, data-driven way to prune search spaces that complements our current evolutionary approaches.</details> | Xinyu Jiang et.al. | Tsinghua University, McGill University, George Washington University, JD Intelligent Cities Research, Beijing Technology and Business University |  | [2505.06608](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06608) | — |

The empirical rigor is low; they compare against weak baselines (BestFit for bin packing, a 2000-era heuristic for ADMM) and frame it as a position paper. However, the application of LLM-evolution to discover symbolic mathematical update rules (for ADMM step sizes) rather than just procedural code is a concrete use case we should consider for our EvoCut work.

They claim 80% success on a custom dataset of 100 small-scale problems, outperforming standard CoT. The results are likely real but limited to small instances where standard relaxations work well. The only useful takeaway for us is the explicit 'convexification' prompting step—asking the LLM to map specific non-convex mathematical terms to their convex surrogates—which could be a useful operator in an automated OR modeling agent, but the rest is standard engineering.</details> | Xinyue Peng et.al. | Southeast University, Zhejiang University, Purple Mountain Laboratories | arXiv.org | [2505.02091](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02091) | **[link](https://github.com/Tibbers0310/LLM-OptiRA)** |

On the NL4Opt-Code benchmark, this allows open-source models like Llama-3-70B to match GPT-4 performance (improving accuracy from ~23% to ~57%). The key takeaway for us is the effectiveness of 'metadata-augmented indexing'—bridging the semantic gap between natural language problem descriptions and rigid solver APIs by retrieving based on functional descriptions rather than code embeddings. We should apply this metadata indexing strategy to the code retrieval modules in our OR-Bench and AlgoEvo agents.</details> | Tasnim Ahmed et.al. | Queen's University | Learning and Intelligent Optimization | [2505.01485](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01485) | — |

They evaluate 9 frameworks (including FunSearch, ReEvo, AIDE), finding that FunSearch combined with reasoning models (o3-mini) yields the most robust performance, though agents still struggle significantly with strict feasibility constraints (valid solution rates often <60%). **Takeaway:** We should immediately integrate CO-Bench into our pipeline to benchmark AlgoEvo against ReEvo and FunSearch; this saves us months of data curation and provides a standardized metric to prove our method's superiority.</details> | Weiwei Sun et.al. | Carnegie Mellon University | arXiv.org | [2504.04310](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04310) | **[link](https://github.com/sunnweiwei/CO-Bench)** |

Unlike 'execution accuracy' (which fails on unit scaling) or 'canonical accuracy' (which fails on variable permutation), they achieve 100% accuracy on a new dataset of equivalent formulations including cuts and slack variables. The core insight is replacing output comparison with a 'propose-mapping-and-verify' loop, effectively using the LLM to construct a proof of equivalence. We must adopt this methodology for the OR-Bench evaluation pipeline immediately, as it eliminates the false negatives currently plaguing our generation benchmarks.</details> | Haotian Zhai et.al. | Stanford University, The University of Texas at Austin | International Conference on Machine Learning | [2502.14760](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14760) | **[link](https://github.com/HumainLab/EquivaMap)** |

They achieve SOTA results on NL4OPT and IndustryOR, outperforming fine-tuned models like ORLM while using significantly fewer samples than naive approaches. **Key Takeaway:** The integration of symbolic equivalence checking (SMT) to prune the search tree is a technique we should immediately steal; implementing this in AlgoEvo would allow us to discard functionally identical code/math mutants before expensive evaluation, directly addressing our sample efficiency bottleneck.</details> | Nicolás Astorga et.al. | University of Cambridge, University of Hawaii at Manoa | ICML | [2411.01679](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01679) | **[link](https://github.com/jumpynitro/AutoFormulator)** |

Results are rigorous and demonstrate that while DPO leads to generator collapse and infeasibility in constrained spaces, MargE maintains diversity and significantly improves sample efficiency, matching specialized solvers like LaMBO-2 on medium-difficulty tasks. The critical takeaway is that standard alignment methods (DPO/RLHF) are ill-suited for optimization because they discard information about *how much* better a solution is; MargE fixes this by satisfying the Strong Interpolation Criteria. We should immediately evaluate replacing the RL/update component in AlgoEvo with the MargE objective to improve the stability and quality of our evolved heuristics.</details> | Angelica Chen et.al. | Genentech, New York University | International Conference on Machine Learning | [2410.22296](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22296) | — |

It categorizes individual representations into code-centric, hybrid, and 'augmented' (injecting domain concepts into prompts), but provides no new benchmarks or empirical validation.

While the authors incorrectly claim novelty over FunSearch by arguing they generate 'complete algorithms' (FunSearch also does this), their specific contribution of **NOS-based variation** is valuable: they randomly inject domain-specific strategies (e.g., 'prioritize high-degree nodes') into prompts to guide the LLM's mutation steps. This strategy-guided mutation is a simple, effective mechanism to force exploration and prevent mode collapse that we should replicate in AlgoEvo for VRP heuristics. Results are positive against basic baselines (SA, HC) on graphs up to 1,500 nodes, though the baselines are relatively weak.</details> | He Yu et.al. | Xidian University | arXiv.org | [2410.17656](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17656) | **[link](null)** |

They achieve ~11% accuracy gains over GPT-4o and ORLM on benchmarks like NL4Opt and IndustryOR, primarily by reducing formulation hallucinations through the structured intermediate step and preference optimization. For our OR-Bench work, the key takeaway is the concrete recipe for using KTO to align symbolic modeling agents, which appears more effective than standard SFT for enforcing constraints in smaller models. While not an evolutionary search paper, it provides a strong, locally runnable baseline for our OR modeling evaluations.</details> | Caigao Jiang et.al. | Ant Group, East China Normal University, Nanjing University | International Conference on Learning Representations | [2410.13213](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13213) | **[link](https://github.com/caigaojiang/LLMOPT)** |

They claim to outperform Gurobi's initial feasible solutions, but the results are unconvincing as they ignore standard heuristics (like ALNS) and Gurobi's rapid improvement over time. The method offers no novelty for our evolutionary search work; the temperature annealing (1.0 -> 0.01) is a trivial heuristic that does not justify the cost of fine-tuning for combinatorial problems.</details> | Teng Wang et.al. | Huawei, University of Hong Kong | arXiv.org | [2409.04464](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04464) | — |

The authors manually cleaned these datasets and re-evaluated methods, finding that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) often degrades performance compared to standard prompting, while fine-tuned models (ORLM) and multi-agent systems (Chain-of-Experts) perform best. The immediate takeaway is that we must adopt their cleaned datasets for our OR-Bench project; using the original open-source versions is no longer defensible. Additionally, the failure of CoT on these tasks suggests we should prioritize multi-agent or fine-tuned approaches for symbolic formulation tasks.</details> | Ziyang Xiao et.al. | Zhejiang University, Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab, Singapore University of Social Sciences, Hangzhou High-Tech Zone (Binjiang) Institute of Blockchain and Data Security | International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence | [2508.10047](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10047) | **[link](https://llm4or.github.io/LLM4OR)** |

The results are rigorous, introducing a new hard benchmark (NLP4LP) where they outperform GPT-4o by ~40% and beat Chain-of-Experts. The most stealable insight is the 'Structure Detection Agent': instead of relying on the LLM to write generic constraints, we should explicitly prompt for and map high-level structures to efficient solver APIs (like SOS constraints) to improve performance in our EvoCut and AlgoEvo pipelines.

Results are strong: fine-tuning Llama-3-8B on their 29k synthetic samples improves accuracy from 13.6% to 51.1%, validating the data quality. **Key Takeaway:** The 'Reverse Socratic' synthesis pipeline (Formal Model → Code → NL Question) is the superior strategy for generating synthetic OR datasets because it guarantees solvability and ground truth by construction, unlike forward generation. We should steal this pipeline for generating robust test instances for OR-Bench and potentially for training our OR agents.</details> | Zhicheng YANG et.al. | The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, ETH Zurich, Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab, City University of Hong Kong, Sun Yat-sen University, MBZUAI, University of California Merced, Chongqing University | International Conference on Learning Representations | [2407.09887](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09887) | **[link](https://github.com/yangzhch6/ReSocratic)** |

They claim to outperform GPT-4 on a custom dataset of 100 LP/MILP problems, though the complexity appears limited to textbook-level instances.

The authors show strong empirical results on PMO/TDC benchmarks, demonstrating that LLM-guided evolution improves sample efficiency over random baselines. The most useful takeaway is that a fine-tuned, domain-specific small model (BioT5) can perform competitively with GPT-4 as a genetic operator, validating the strategy of using specialized, cheaper models for evolutionary operators in our AlgoEvo pipeline. However, the method relies on simple prompt substitution and chemistry-specific pruning heuristics (Tanimoto distance) rather than a novel evolutionary architecture.</details> | Haorui Wang et.al. | MIT, Cornell University, University of Toronto, Georgia Institute of Technology, University of California, Los Angeles, Université de Montréal, Vector Institute, Mila - Quebec AI Institute, University of Wuppertal, Deep Principle Inc. | International Conference on Learning Representations | [2406.16976](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16976) | **[link](https://github.com/zoom-wang112358/MOLLEO)** |

The 'End-to-End' component simply maps a pre-trained Random Forest into MIP constraints (following Biggs et al., 2022), which is a known technique. The results are tautological: solving a sub-problem (by heuristically fixing variables) is faster than solving the full MIP, but incurs an optimality gap of up to ~12%. The only takeaway is the concept of 'semantic decomposition'—using an LLM to identify variable dependencies for local search—but their implementation is too trivial to be useful for our AlgoEvo or VRP work.</details> | Zihao Jiao et.al. | Tsinghua University, Beijing Technology and Business University | arXiv.org | [2406.10958](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10958) | — |

While they claim performance comparable to Bayesian Optimization on toy benchmarks (Ackley, Rosenbrock), the approach incurs massive inference costs for results that are often statistically indistinguishable from or worse than standard baselines. The primary takeaway is a negative one: LLMs are inefficient and imprecise regressors for raw numerical vectors compared to traditional ML methods. This confirms we should restrict our LLM surrogate efforts to semantic tasks (code/heuristics) rather than numerical parameter tuning.</details> | Hao Hao et.al. | Shanghai Jiao Tong University, East China Normal University | Swarm and Evolutionary Computation | [2406.10675](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10675) | **[link](https://github.com/hhyqhh/LAEA.git)** |

They provide ~800 optimization word problems with ground truth, finding that while o1-preview dominates on complex LP tasks (36% vs GPT-4o's 23%), it surprisingly underperforms on simpler instances. **Takeaway:** We should scrape their dataset to augment our 'OR-Bench' and 'OR formulations' training data.

While they claim success on simple 2D benchmarks, the method is orders of magnitude slower than standard baselines (3 hours vs. <1 minute) and degrades significantly in high-dimensional settings (20D+).

The results are compelling: the fine-tuned 350M model achieves ~85% normalized performance on benchmarks where GPT-4 Turbo only reaches ~14-30%, largely because the small model learns to select specialized evolutionary strategies (like BIPOP-CMA-ES) while GPT-4 defaults to generic gradient-based solvers. **Key Takeaway:** We can replace the expensive GPT-4 calls in our evolutionary search loop with a specialized, fine-tuned local model (CodeLlama-7B) trained on our historical search successes, significantly improving both sample efficiency and scalability.
