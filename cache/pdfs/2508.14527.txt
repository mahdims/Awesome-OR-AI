Abstract
The generation of safety-critical scenarios in simulation has become increasingly
crucial for safety evaluation in autonomous vehicles (AV) prior to road deployment
in society. However, current approaches largely rely on predefined threat patterns
or rule-based strategies, which limit their ability to expose diverse and unforeseen
failure modes. To overcome these, we propose SCENGE, a framework that can
generate plentiful safety-critical scenarios by reasoning novel adversarial cases
and then amplifying them with complex traffic flows. Given a simple prompt of a
benign scene, it first performs Meta-Scenario Generation, where a large language
model (LLM), grounded in structured driving knowledge (e.g., traffic regulations,
real-world accident records), infers an adversarial agent whose behavior poses a
threat that is both plausible and deliberately challenging. This meta-scenario is
then specified in executable code for precise in-simulator control. Subsequently,
Complex Scenario Evolution uses background vehicles to amplify the core threat
introduced by Meta-Scenario. It builds an adversarial collaborator graph to identify
key agent trajectories for optimization. These perturbations are designed to simulta-
neously reduce the ego vehicle’s maneuvering space and create critical occlusions.
Extensive experiments conducted on multiple reinforcement learning (RL) based
AV models show that SCENGE uncovers more severe collision cases (+31.96%) on
average than SoTA baselines. Additionally, our SCENGE can be applied to large
model based AV systems and deployed on different simulators; we further observe
that adversarial training on our scenarios improves the model robustness. Finally,
we validate our framework through real-world vehicle tests and human evaluation,
confirming that the generated scenarios are both plausible and critical. We hope
our paper can build up a critical step towards building public trust and ensuring
their safe deployment. Our codes can be found at https://scenge.github.io.

Introduction
As autonomous vehicles (AVs) [17, 41, 37, 20] approach widespread deployment, ensuring their
safety and reliability to earn public trust has become critical [25, 24, 21, 34]. However, this endeavor
is challenging due to the scarcity of real-world data on rare yet critical incidents. Simulation-based
testing [2, 36] offers a controlled, reusable, and cost-effective way of evaluating behavior under
various conditions, particularly safety-critical scenarios that probe their safety capacity. Current
scenario generation approaches, which largely rely on predefined threat templates [58, 56, 50] or
rule-based strategies [6, 49, 5, 59], struggle to reveal the full spectrum of safety flaws. Due to these
weak risk exposure abilities, AVs retain undiscovered vulnerabilities from inadequate validation. This
challenge is closely related to the field of adversarial machine learning. In this domain, research

focuses on exposing the vulnerabilities of deep neural networks through various attack methodologies.
Such work also involves evaluating model robustness and developing more resilient architectures
[48, 29, 33, 57, 44, 26, 23, 30, 28, 27, 35, 32, 15, 31, 22].

narios generated by our SCENGE: a pedestrian
emerging from behind a parked truck, with the
threat amplified by a background vehicle obstruct-
ing the line-of-sight to the adversary.
To address these limitations,
we propose
SCENGE, a two-stage framework that exposes
safety vulnerabilities in AV by performing ad-
versarial threat generation and collaborative tra-
jectory evolution. Our first stage, Meta-Scenario
Generation, uses a LLM to creatively gener-
ate a core adversarial threat from a benign text
prompt. To ensure this threat is both plausible
and challenging, a retrieval augmented genera-
tion RAG [53] framework grounds the LLM’s
reasoning in a structured knowledge base of traf-
fic regulations, driver qualification standards,
and realistic pre-crash scenarios. The generated
meta-scenario is then expressed as executable
Scenic code [11, 12], allowing for diverse and
scalable instantiation in the CARLA simulator
[8]. However, the threat created by a single
adversarial agent is often predictable and insuf-
ficient to create a truly critical dilemma for the
AV. Our second stage, Complex Scenario Evolution, therefore crafts more complex threats by coordi-
nating the surrounding background traffic. It first builds an adversarial collaborator graph to identify
the most influential vehicles. The trajectories of these key agents are then carefully optimized. Rather
than causing direct collisions or simple chaos, these optimizations intensify interaction complexity
by strategically limiting the ego’s escape paths and obstructing its line-of-sight, ultimately increasing
the likelihood of a critical incident.
Extensive experiments on multiple RL-based AV models demonstrate that SCENGE uncovers more
severe collision cases (+31.96%) on average than state-of-the-art baselines. We also confirm its
broad generalizability: the scenarios effectively challenge advanced VLM models like LMDrive, are
transferable to the MetaDrive simulator. Beyond testing, we demonstrate the practical value of our
data through adversarial training. Models trained on our scenarios exhibit substantially improved
robustness. This improvement is validated on real-world nuScenes data, where the enhanced models
make demonstrably safer decisions. To bridge the sim-to-real gap, we further validate our approach
with real-world vehicle tests and human driver surveys, which confirm our generated scenarios
represent plausible and critical real-world risks. Our main contributions are:
• We propose SCENGE, a two-stage framework that generates safety-critical scenarios by
seamlessly combining knowledge-grounded LLM reasoning with multi-agent trajectory
optimization.
• We introduce two core components: Meta-Scenario Generation, which generates richly
detailed meta-scenarios by grounding an LLM’s reasoning in knowledge priors; Complex
Scenario Evolution, which enhances the resulting threats by optimizing the trajectory of key
background vehicles identified via an Adversarial Collaborator Graph.
• Extensive experiments conducted on RL-based AV models show the effectiveness of
SCENGE (+31.96% collision rate on average) compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Related Work
Simulation-Based Testing for AV. Simulation-based testing, facilitated by platforms such as CARLA
[8], MetaDrive [18], and LimSim [52], offers a cost-effective and controlled environment for evaluat-
ing AVs under diverse driving conditions. A key advantage is the ability to replicate rare yet critical
scenarios that are impractical or hazardous to test in the real world. This capability for controlled,
repeatable testing is critical for systematically identifying performance vulnerabilities and ultimately
validating the safety of AVs.

Safety-Critical Scenario Generation. The generation of safety-critical scenarios is crucial for
evaluating AV safety, with existing approaches including generative models that learn from real-world
data [6, 43, 42, 39, 9], optimization-based methods that synthesize scenarios via tailored objectives
[4, 49, 3, 54], and semantic-driven methods that incorporate high-level context [14, 62, 50, 51, 61].
More recent works leverage language models for generation from text or logs [19, 60], or enhance
coverage through semantic replay and trajectory compression [47, 10].
However, these approaches primarily focus on single-agent rule violations or replaying observed
patterns, thus failing to reveal novel, compound failure modes. Even recent LLM-based methods,
while improving semantic coverage, still lack fine-grained control over multi-agent interactions.
These limitations motivate SCENGE, our framework that addresses semantic novelty and emergent
risk through structured generation and collaborative perturbation.
3
SCENGE Approach
SCENGE is designed to target AV system failures stemming from explicit rule violations and subtle
multi-agent interactions. An overview is illustrated in Fig. 2.
3.1
Problem Definition
Let Smeta = {aego, aadv | R, L} denote the meta scenario, which includes an ego vehicle aego and
a single adversarial agent aadv operating within an environmental context defined by road type R and
traffic light state L. The adversarial agent is further specified by semantic properties (c, p, b), denoting
its type, position, and behavior. To construct such scenarios, we start from a simple prompt of a benign
scene Φbase, augmented by a fixed instruction prompt Φinst to induce safety-violating behavior. A
retrieval function fR selects relevant entries from a knowledge base D, and the resulting context is
used by an LLM fLLM to produce semantic descriptions ⟨Φc, Φp, Φb, ΦR, ΦL⟩for adversarial agent
and environment properties. These are subsequently parsed into structured values (c, p, b, R, L) and
instantiated to define Smeta.
We define the adversarial scenario as Sadv = Smeta ∪{a1, . . . , aN}, where N denotes the number
of background vehicles. Each background vehicle ai follows a trajectory τi = {(xt, yt)}T
t=0,
representing its simulated coordinates over T frames, where i∈{1, . . . , N}. A subset of background
3


--- Page 4 ---
vehicles, indexed by K ⊂{1, . . . , N}, is selected for perturbation. Their trajectory segments are
optimized to induce collaborative risky behaviors that increase the threat level of Smeta. Specifically,
for each selected vehicle ai⋆with i⋆∈K, we identify a keyframe t⋆
i⋆as the most influential frame,
and define the corresponding perturbable segment ˜τi⋆⊂τi⋆as a temporal window centered at this
keyframe. These segments are perturbed by optimizing the objective function L, yielding the final
adversarial scenario Sadv with optimized segments {˜τ ⋆
i⋆}i⋆∈K.
3.2
Meta-Scenario Generation
Given a simple prompt Φbase, which typically specifies a normal traffic situation without threats (e.g.,
the ego car is driving across the corner), our goal is to construct a meta-scenario Smeta
in which aadv introduces a safety-critical threat. The process comprises two main components: ❶
constructing a structured driving knowledge base via RAG, and ❷generating an executable scenario
description using an LLM informed by that prior.
Safety Driving Knowledge Construction. The knowledge base D = {Dr, Dl, Dc} consists of three
components, each representing a distinct aspect of driving knowledge essential for simulating norma-
tive and adversarial traffic behavior. ❶Dr contains 27 driving regulations segmented from official
manuals in the USA, Germany, and China, covering behaviors such as lane merging, overtaking, and
other maneuvers. ❷Dl includes 100 standardized driver’s license test questions and answers that
assess traffic rule knowledge, situational awareness, and safe behavior selection. Together, Dr and
Dl provide normative behavioral priors intentionally violated to construct safety-critical adversarial
behaviors. In contrast, ❸Dc comprises 14 pre-crash scenarios drawn from taxonomies in the NHTSA
Pre-Crash Typology Report [38] (e.g., unprotected left turns, red-light violations), providing concrete
adversarial patterns for scenario construction. Collectively, these components inform the synthesis of
plausible threat scenarios and support the generation of critical adversarial conditions.
LLM-Driven Scenario Generation. Given a simple prompt Φbase of a benign scene, the LLM is
prompted to generate a detailed, safety-critical scenario by introducing one main adversarial agent
aadv into the scenario. It infers the agent’s properties and the associated environmental context
through in-context learning [7]. However, simply adopting an LLM may lead to unsafe or unrealistic
critical scenarios; thus, we ground the reasoning process in structured driving knowledge. To this
end, relevant knowledge is retrieved from the database D and combined with the instruction prompt
Φinst to form the input to the LLM fLLM. The generation process is formalized as:
⟨Φc, Φp, Φb, ΦR, ΦL⟩= fLLM (aego, Φbase, fR(D, Φbase) | Φinst) ,
(3.1)
where each Φ∗represents a text description of a scenario element, including the adversarial agent’s
properties and environmental context. The instruction prompt Φinst explicitly guides the model to
generate rule-violating yet plausible actions, grounded in retrieved safety knowledge. Although
expressed in textual form, the generation is controlled through few-shot prompting and slot-based
templates, ensuring the outputs remain structured and scenario-compatible.
The generated descriptions are then parsed into structured values (c, p, b, R, L) and populated into
a predefined Scenic template. This template encodes scenario-level semantics while enforcing
syntactic and physical constraints, bridging language-driven generation and executable simulation.
The resulting program is run in the simulator to instantiate Smeta.
3.3
Complex Scenario Evolution
Building on the generated meta-scenario, Complex Scenario Evolution enhances its complexity by
introducing background vehicles {a1, . . . , aN} with collaborative risky trajectories. To that end, their
interactions with aadv and aego are adjusted to create a more challenging scenario for the AV. This
process comprises two main components: ❶Collaborator Search, which identifies the background
vehicles that can most amplify the adversarial nature of the scenario, and ❷Trajectory Perturbation,
which adjusts the selected vehicles to maximize the adversarial impact.
Collaborator Search. To identify influential background vehicles, we construct an Adversarial
Collaborator Graph G, where each node corresponds to an agent in the scenario, and the edges reflect
directional behavioral relevance, particularly emphasizing the impact of background vehicles on the
ego vehicle and adversarial agent. This graph is derived from a frame-wise attention matrix Ma that
4


--- Page 5 ---
models trajectory-level dependencies using ego and adversarial trajectories as queries and background
trajectories as keys. Specifically:
Ma = (τego, τadv) · (τ1, . . . , τN)⊤
√
d
+ Mm + log Md,
(3.2)
where d is the dimension of τ, Mm enforces causality by preventing attention to future frames, and
Md introduces a temporal decay bias to emphasize recent interactions.
Based on Ma, we perform Collaborator Search in two stages. First, we aggregate attention scores
across frames to estimate each background vehicle’s relevance to the ego vehicle and the adversarial
agent. This process identifies the Top-k most influential vehicles, which form the collaborator set
K. Then, for each i⋆∈K, we locate the keyframe t⋆
i⋆receiving the highest attention score for
vehicle ai⋆, and extract a local temporal window ˜τi⋆centered at keyframe as its perturbable trajectory
segment. These segments serve as the input to the subsequent trajectory perturbation module.
Trajectory Perturbation. We optimize the perturbable segments {˜τi⋆}i⋆∈K of selected collaborators
(indexed by K) to maximize the adversarial impact on the ego vehicle. This is formulated as the
following objective:
{˜τ ⋆
i⋆}i⋆∈K = arg max
{˜τi⋆}i⋆∈K
L(˜τego, ˜τadv, {˜τi⋆}i⋆∈K),
(3.3)
The optimization follows an iterative, gradient-based procedure. Specifically, for each perturbable
segment, we compute the gradient of L w.r.t the trajectory coordinates and update them in the
direction that increases the loss. Each update step uses a small, fixed step size and is projected back to
the feasible space to ensure realism. The process continues until convergence or a predefined number
of steps is reached.

The objective function L comprises three components, as shown in Eq. (3.4). ❶Lego minimizes the
Euclidean distance between the perturbed background trajectory ˜τi⋆and the ego trajectory ˜τego within
a temporal window. ❷Lsmooth penalizes second-order differences ∆2˜τi⋆to reduce abrupt motion
changes. ❸Locc minimizes the normalized perpendicular distance via a 2D cross product, promoting
alignment along the ego–adversary line-of-sight. From a behavioral modeling perspective, Lego
encourages spatial proximity to induce planning hesitation, Lsmooth ensures kinematic feasibility via
smoothness constraints, collectively balancing adversarial strength with physical plausibility, and Locc
amplifies perceptual ambiguity through occlusion. Finally, the optimized perturbations {˜τ ⋆
i⋆}i⋆∈K
replace the corresponding segments of the original trajectories, yielding the final adversarial scenario
Sadv, which poses a significant threat to the ego vehicle’s safe driving.
3.4
Overall Generation Workflow
Our workflow begins with the Meta-Scenario Generation module. This module takes a benign text
description as input. First, an LLM generates a detailed textual description of a safety-critical threat.
This generation process is grounded in a structured driving knowledge base. The LLM then translates
this textual description into a parameterized Scenic script. Finally, this script is instantiated within
the CARLA simulator to create the executable meta-scenario.
Next, we process the background traffic for the meta-scenario. We use CARLA’s Traffic Manager to
generate a flow of background vehicles and record their baseline trajectories. The Complex Scenario
Evolution module then analyzes these trajectories offline. It builds an Adversarial Collaborator Graph
to identify the most influential background vehicles to act as collaborators. The module selects critical
segments of their trajectories and optimizes them to maximize the overall threat. This optimization
aims to restrict the ego vehicle’s maneuvering space and create critical occlusions. For the final
evaluation, we replay the complete scenario in a closed-loop simulation. The optimized background

Experiment and Evaluation
4.1
Experimental Setup
Simulation environment and benchmark. We utilise the CARLA simulator [8], an open-source
and highly customizable urban driving simulator, to create a closed-loop simulation environment.
We adopt SafeBench [55] as the benchmarking framework, which supports diverse RL-based AV
agents and standardized evaluation. Following [58], we use 8 base traffic scenarios (e.g., Straight
Obstacle, Lane Changing) curated from the NHTSA Pre-Crash Typology Report [38], each
containing 10 diverse driving routes. For each route, 10 adversarial scenarios are generated, resulting
in 800 challenging scenarios for evaluation and comparison per method.
AV algorithms. Following [58], we mainly employ 3 representative RL-based AV algorithms as
testing agents, including Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [40], Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) [16],
and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) [13].
Compared baselines. We compare our SCENGE with several existing scenario generation methods,
including Learning-to-Collide (LC) [6], AdvSim (AS) [49], Carla Scenario Generator (CS) [5],
Adversarial Trajectory Optimization (AT) [59], and ChatScene [58]. For fair comparisons, each
method is applied on the same 8 base scenarios and routes to generate 800 challenging scenarios
under consistent generation logic and evaluation settings.
Metrics. Following SafeBench [55], we adopt a set of key metrics to evaluate AV performance in
generated scenarios. Two core indicators are used: the collision rate (CR ↑) measures the frequency of
collisions and reflects safety risk, and the overall score (OS ↓) aggregates system-level performance.
In addition, we evaluate three additional dimensions: the safety level (frequency of running red lights
(RR ↑), frequency of running stop signs (SS ↑), and average distance driven out of road (OR ↑),
the functionality level (route following stability (RF ↓), average percentage of route completion
(Comp ↓), and average time spent to complete the route (TS ↑)), and the etiquette level (average
acceleration (ACC ↑), average yaw velocity (YV ↑), and frequency of lane invasion (LI ↑). Higher
(↑) values indicate worse performance, while ↓indicates the contrary.
Implementation details. All experiments were conducted on a server with an Intel(R) Core(TM)
i9-14900K CPU and two NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPUs with 24GB memory. The LLM
used for Meta-Scenario Generationis qwq-32b [46], the reasoning model from the Qwen series.
In the Complex Scenario Evolution module, we construct 10 background vehicles and perturb the
trajectories of 4 selected ones, each over 60% of their trajectory. The 4 perturbed vehicles are selected
6


--- Page 7 ---
based on the highest attention relevance to ego and adversarial agents. The 60% perturbation window
is centered around each vehicle’s most relevant keyframe. We set γ in the decay matrix to 0.8. In the
loss calculation, we set λ1 = 0.3, λ2 = 0.2, and λ3 = 0.5.
4.2
Main Results
Our main results, presented in Tab. 1 and Tab. 2, compare SCENGE against baseline methods across
eight base scenarios. To ensure a robust and generalizable evaluation, all metrics are averaged over
three distinct RL agents, as detailed in Sec. 4.1. This approach validates that our scenarios pose a
universal challenge to a range of modern driving policies, rather than merely exploiting agent-specific
flaws. The tables offer complementary views: Tab. 1 details the CR and OS for each individual
scenario, whereas Tab. 2 assesses the overall impact on AV behavior from the three key aspects of
safety and risk exposure, functionality under stress, and driving etiquette, with all results averaged
across the scenarios.

tionality, and etiquette dimensions. Each value represents

Safety and Risk Exposure.
As
shown in Tab. 1, SCENGE achieves
the highest average CR. Notably, this
high collision rate is not achieved by
forcing simplistic rule violations. In
fact, the scores for RR, SS, and OR
are not the highest, as seen in Tab. 2.
This outcome is a direct result of our
design philosophy. We avoid creat-
ing simplistic, predictable setups that
rely on obvious rule violations. In-
stead, SCENGE focuses on generat-
ing high-pressure situations from com-
plex multi-agent interactions. These plausible scenarios challenge the predictive and planning ca-
pabilities under pressure. They force the vehicle to navigate moments where no single, simple rule
applies. Consequently, the resulting collisions expose more profound and subtle vulnerabilities in the
AV’s core logic, rather than surface-level failures in rule compliance.
Functionality Challenges. As shown in Tab. 1, SCENGE achieves the lowest average OS. Addi-
tionally, Tab. 2 shows a 4.96% drop in RF and a 29.16% reduction in Comp. The moderate TS is
caused by early collisions, which demonstrates that SCENGE induces rapid and decisive failures by
persistently disrupting the AV’s planning.

As shown in Tab. 2,
SCENGE increases ACC, YV, and LI by 16.5%,
12.7%, and 8.48% respectively. These results
suggest that SCENGE causes AV to behave less
smoothly and more erratically in ways that re-
main socially plausible. Introducing temporally
coordinated perturbations across multiple agents
disrupts fine-grained control and social driving
compliance, revealing limitations that simpler,
single-agent or rule-based methods fail to ex-
pose.

Ablation Studies
We perform ablation experiments by selectively
disabling key modules and observing the effect
on performance. Otherwise specified, this part
keeps the same setting as the main experiment.
Fig. 3 reports the results under different settings.
❶Knowledge Prior. Removing Dr yields CR 79.4% and OS 52.3%, reflecting its role in guiding rule-
focused violations. Removing Dl gives CR 77.4% and OS 55.2%, showing its effect on enhancing
7


--- Page 8 ---
logical consistency in behavior. Removing Dc results in CR 80.5% and OS 52.1%, confirming its
importance in producing realistic and high-risk scenarios.
❷LLM. Both GPT-4o and qwq-32b demonstrate strong capabilities, yielding similar CRs of 81.3%
and 82.0%, respectively. This suggests that the performance is not critically sensitive to the specific
choice of a powerful LLM.
❸Collaborator Graph. We ablate the number of perturbed agents by selecting 2, 4, and 6 collaborators.
Perturbing 4 agents performs best with CR 82% and OS 49.9%, balancing adversarial strength and
scenario plausibility. Interestingly, perturbing 6 agents (CR 78.1%) is less effective than perturbing
2 (CR 80.3%). We hypothesize that this occurs because an excessive number of agents transforms
our intended coordinated, precise threat into easily avoidable chaos. Their mutual interference and
abnormal behavior likely prompt the AV to adopt a conservative policy. This hypothesis is also
supported by OS, where the 6-agent setting yields a higher score (56.1%) compared to the 2-agent
setting (55.1%).
❹Temporal Modeling. The full setting (with both mask and decay) yields the best result with CR 82%
and OS 49.9%. Removing the temporal mask reduces temporal causality in collaborator selection,
leads to CR 79.3% and OS 55.6%, while removing the temporal decay results in CR 78.2% and OS
57.3%. These results highlight the complementary role of both components in capturing temporally
coherent influence.
❺Perturbation Ratio. We compare three perturbation ratios centered around the selected keyframe:
50%, 60%, and 70%. Perturbing 60% of the segment achieves the best result with CR 82% and OS
49.9%. 50% leads to CR 80.2% and OS 53.4%, indicating insufficient behavioral deviation, while
70% causes CR 81.1% and OS 52.1% due to over-modification and reduced plausibility. These results
shows moderate ratio balances realism and adversarial effect.
❻Loss. We ablate each component in L to assess its contribution. Removing Lego leads to CR
78.6% and OS 55.3%, reflecting reduced collision targeting. Excluding Lsmooth yields CR 80.2% and
OS 54.3%, with trajectories becoming visibly unstable. Removing Locc results in CR 79.4% and
OS 56.8%, indicating weaker alignment between adversary and ego. The full loss yields the best
trade-off, and ablating any term consistently reduces CR and increases OS.

We study the generalizability of SCENGE:
❶effectiveness on other AV models; and
❷applicability on other simulators.
Model Generalization. Beyond RL-based
AV models, we further evaluate our gen-
erated scenarios on LMDrive [41], a large
vision-language model for AV deployed on
the CARLA Leaderboard [45]. LMDrive
navigates by following natural language in-
structions sequentially, using the multi-view camera and Lidar perception for scene understanding
and planning. To accommodate its instruction-driven execution mode, we redesign the test routes
into multi-instruction sequences. Evaluation follows LMDrive’s original metrics: Route Completion
(RC), Infraction Score (IS), and Driving Score (DS). We evaluate LMDrive under three increas-
ingly challenging settings: ❶ego-only benign routes as a baseline, ❷meta-scenarios with a single
adversarial agent, and ❸full adversarial scenarios generated by our framework, including the per-
turbed background vehicle. As shown in Tab. 3, LMDrive’s performance drops from 87.7 DS in the
benign case to 83.7 in meta-scenarios and further to 80.4 under full adversarial conditions. These
results demonstrate that our generated scenarios significantly stress LMDrive’s planning capability,
especially under rare or occluded interactions.
Simulator Generalization. We validated the generalizability of SCENGE in MetaDrive [18] sim-
ulator, a lightweight platform for RL research. Despite substantial differences in rendering and
physics, SCENGE’s modular design facilitated a successful port. As shown in Fig. 4, our framework
successfully generated effective safety-critical scenarios that induced high CR in MetaDrive. This
result demonstrates the broad applicability of our approach.

Training on the Generated Scenarios
Figure 4: Applicability of SCENGE on MetaDrive simulator.
This section evaluates the utility of
our SCENGE in enhancing AV robust-
ness by adversarial training on the gen-
erated scenarios. Specifically, we eval-
uate the robustified RL agent on both
simulated data and real-world data.
Robustness evaluation in simula-
tion. We adversarially train the SAC-
based ego vehicle across eight base
traffic scenarios using scenes from
the first eight routes per scenario, and
evaluate on unseen scenes from the remaining two routes. The training process uses 500 epochs
with a learning rate of 0.0001. As shown in Tab. 4, adversarial training with SCENGE-generated
scenarios yields the best results among methods, reducing the CR by 3.1% while increasing the OS
by 94.7%. These results demonstrate that our method generates scenarios missing from standard AV
training. Adversarial training on these data remedies the AV vulnerabilities, leading to a significant
improvement in robustness.

adversarially trained model on real-

[1] to address the visual domain gap
between simulation and reality. In par-
ticular, we first manually select 140
scenario segments (2700 images) with
latent risks, such as a pedestrian standing by the roadside; subsequently, we evaluate both the original
RL model and the enhanced model on these real-world image sequences. The enhanced model
achieved a 21.7% lower Euclidean distance to the ground truth trajectory than the original model,
indicating safer and more stable decisions. This result demonstrates that the robustness gained from
our scenarios transfers effectively to real-world perception data.

Figure 5: Real-World Experiments.
Here, we conducted real-world ex-
periments in a closed road, where
we arranged a layout that is similar
to our generated scenario and tested
a real-world vehicle (Fig. 5).
Due
to commercial confidentiality, the ap-
pearance of our test vehicle has been
obscured. Under strict safety proto-
cols, we recreated and repeated two
challenging scenarios 15 times each:
a pedestrian suddenly emerging from
an occlusion, and an unprotected left-
turn challenged by an accelerating
scooter. Despite safety measures de-
signed to lower the scenarios’ diffi-
culty (e.g., limiting vehicle speed),
the AV exhibited critical failures. In
73.3% of the pedestrian tests, the vehicle failed to react to the pedestrian’s emergence in a timely
manner. Similarly, in 60% of the left-turn tests, it failed to alter its trajectory to avoid the conflicting
scooter, exposing a decisive vulnerability. These results provide definitive, physical-world evidence
that our generated scenarios identify physical risks for autonomous systems, not just simulation
artifacts.

Discussion and Analysis
Computational Cost. We compare the per-scenario generation cost of SCENGE against the baselines
in Sec. 4.1. When generating in batches (e.g., 5 Scenic scripts, each instantiating 20 variations), our
framework averages approximately 0.024 GPU hours per scenario. In contrast, AS requires 0.06
GPU hours, AT needs 0.13 GPU hours, and LC takes 0.17 GPU hours. Our approach thus reduces
the required generation time by 60% compared to AS, 81.5% compared to AT, and 85.9% compared
to LC. Furthermore, methods like CS and ChatScene are bottlenecked by non-scalable expert effort.
This demonstrates SCENGE’s superior efficiency and scalability for large-scale AV testing.
Human Evaluation. We conducted a human study with 30 licensed drivers to assess the real-world
plausibility and perceived danger of our generated scenarios. In the study, participants viewed 40
unique videos and rated them using a 5-point scale. The survey covered all eight base scenarios
used in our experiments, with five distinct variations selected for each. To mitigate order effects and
learning biases, the videos were presented in a fully randomized sequence. An analysis of 1,200
responses revealed high average scores for both plausibility (4.765 out of 5) and perceived risk (4.934
out of 5). This confirms that human drivers consider the scenarios to be both highly realistic and
critically dangerous.
Case Study. As shown in Fig. 6a, we evaluate the SAC-based ego vehicle across three composite
metrics: safety, task completion, and comfort. These metrics summarize AV behavior by aggregating
relevant low-level indicators. We select Scenario 1 for detailed analysis because its scores lie near the
median across all three dimensions, making it a representative failure case. In Fig. 6b, we show some
frames from the final adversarial scenario. This scenario involves a pedestrian emerging from an
occlusion. The threat is amplified by background vehicles: one occupies the adjacent lane to restrict
maneuvering space (a behavior promoted by Lego), while another obstructs the line-of-sight to the
adversary (guided by Locc). These compounded interactions prevent the ego vehicle from executing a
safe evasive action. This case effectively illustrates how SCENGE uses subtle, coordinated behaviors
of background traffic to expose critical AV vulnerabilities.

Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we introduce SCENGE, a two-stage framework for generating safety-critical scenarios
to expose vulnerabilities in AV. From a benign scene description, SCENGE introduces Meta-Scenario
Generation and Complex Scenario Evolution to generate scenarios that are more likely to cause
failures. Experiments on multiple RL-based AV models show that SCENGE reveals more severe
collision cases. Future work: A primary direction is to collaborate with automotive manufacturers,
integrating our SCENGE to evaluate the safety of their proprietary, real-world AV algorithms and
systems.
