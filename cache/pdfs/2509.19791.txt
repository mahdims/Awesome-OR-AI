Abstract—This letter addresses the energy efficiency issue in
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted autonomous systems. We
propose a framework for an agentic artificial intelligence (AI)-
powered low-altitude semantic wireless network, that intelligently
orchestrates a sense-communicate-decide-control workflow. A
system-wide energy consumption minimization problem is for-
mulated to enhance mission endurance. This problem holistically
optimizes key operational variables, including UAV’s location,
semantic compression ratio, transmit power of the UAV and
a mobile base station, and binary decision for AI inference
task offloading, under stringent latency and quality-of-service
constraints. To tackle the formulated mixed-integer non-convex
problem, we develop a low-complexity algorithm which can
obtain the globally optimal solution with two-dimensional search.
Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed
design, demonstrating significant reductions in total energy
consumption compared to conventional baseline approaches.

I. INTRODUCTION
D
RIVEN by the advancements in artificial intelligence
(AI), wireless communications, and low-altitude intel-
ligence, autonomous systems featuring unmanned aerial ve-
hicles (UAVs) are becoming integral to a myriad of appli-
cations, including intelligent surveillance, disaster response,
and logistics [1], [2]. These systems typically operate in
a closed loop of sensing, communication, computation, and
action. A critical bottleneck in such UAV-assisted networks
is the transmission of high-dimensional sensor data, such as
real-time video streams, from the UAV to a ground decision-
making entity [3]. This process is exceedingly demanding on
both bandwidth and UAV’s limited energy resources, posing a
significant challenge to mission endurance and scalability.
To overcome this limitation, semantic communication has
emerged as a transformative paradigm [4]–[6]. Unlike tra-
ditional communication systems that focus on bit-level fi-
delity, semantic communication aims to extract and transmit
only the essential, task-relevant meaning embedded within
the source data. This approach can drastically reduce the
volume of transmit data, thereby enhancing both spectral and
energy efficiency. Concurrently, the rise of agentic AI, mostly
powered by large AI models, provides the “brain” for these

autonomous systems, enabling sophisticated reasoning and
decision-making based on the received semantic information
[7]. The integration of semantic communication with agentic
AI thus paves the way for highly intelligent and efficient low-
altitude wireless networks [8].
While the foundational concepts of semantic communica-
tion and AI-driven control have been explored, a holistic un-
derstanding of the system-level design and resource allocation
remains a significant challenge. Prior works have focused on
either the semantic codec design [9] or AI task offloading [10],
without jointly considering the intricate interplay between
the level of semantic compression, physical deployment of
the UAV, and strategic offloading of AI inference tasks. For
instance, deeper semantic compression reduces transmission
energy but increases on-board computation energy. Similarly,
offloading the AI inference task from the edge to a power-
ful cloud server saves local resources but incurs additional
communication latency and energy costs. A comprehensive
framework that jointly optimizes these highly-coupled vari-
ables to enhance the overall system efficiency is therefore
urgently needed.
In this letter, we address this gap by designing an energy-
efficient agentic AI-assisted semantic wireless network. We
consider a collaborative system where a UAV performs se-
mantic sensing, a mobile base station (BS) acts as an edge
intelligence hub, and a robot executes control commands. The
main contributions of this work are summarized as follows:
• We propose a framework for an agentic AI-assisted
low-altitude semantic wireless network that intelligently
orchestrates a sense-communicate-decide-act workflow.
• We formulate a system-wide energy consumption mini-
mization problem that jointly optimizes the UAV’s three-
dimensional (3D) location, the semantic compression
ratio, the transmit powers of the UAV and BS, and the
binary decision of AI inference task offloading (edge
vs. cloud), under latency and quality-of-service (QoS)
constraints. To solve the formulated non-convex problem,
we develop an efficient algorithm which can find the
globally optimal solution.
• Simulation results validate the superiority of the proposed
framework in significantly reducing the system’s energy
consumption compared to baseline approaches.
II. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION
A. Network Model
Consider an agentic AI-assisted semantic wireless network
comprising a single UAV, a mobile BS, a cloud server, and
a robot, as depicted in Fig. 1. The system operates in a low-
altitude environment where the UAV is tasked with tracking a
moving target. The UAV senses information about the target,

which is then semantically compressed and transmitted to the
mobile BS. We consider a mobile BS to leverage its mobil-
ity, thereby maintaining proximity to the UAV and ensuring
a robust communication link. Upon receiving the semantic
information, the mobile BS first reconstructs the original data
using a paired semantic model. Subsequently, it can employ
an embodied large AI model to make intelligent decisions
and generate control commands based on the reconstructed
information. Alternatively, the mobile BS can offload this task
by transmitting the reconstructed data to a cloud server, which
possesses superior computational resources, for command gen-
eration. The final control command is then transmitted to the
robot to execute a specific task.
The operational workflow of the system is illustrated in
Fig. 2. We define an update cycle as the whole process of
handling the data collected in one sensing interval. Each
cycle involves several distinct stages: UAV sensing, on-board
semantic compression, data transmission to the mobile BS,
semantic recovery at the BS, control command generation,
and command transmission to the robot. The control command
generation can be performed either locally at the mobile BS or
remotely at the cloud server. Note that the time and energy for
UAV sensing and the final command transmission to the robot
are neglected, as they are assumed to be constant or negligible
compared to the other components.
For analytical tractability, we establish a 3D Cartesian
coordinate system where the mobile BS is located at the origin,
i.e., (0, 0, 0). The moving target’s location in current time slot
is denoted by (xT, yT, 0). The altitudes of both the mobile BS
and the target are considered negligible relative to the UAV’s
operational altitude. The UAV’s location is given by
LU = (xU, yU, HU) ,
(1)
where HU is the UAV’s altitude.1 Consequently, the dis-
tance between the UAV and the mobile BS is dUB
=
p
x2
U + y2
U + H2
U, and the distance between the UAV and the
moving target is
dUT =
q
(xU −xT)2 + (yU −yT)2 + H2
U.
(2)
B. UAV Sensing, Computation, and Communication Models
Each update cycle commences with the UAV sensing the
target, typically through video capture. The QoS for this
sensing task is modeled as an exponentially decaying function
of the sensing distance [11]:
q = e−ξdUT,
(3)
where ξ is a parameter characterizing the sensing performance.
Let the raw data captured by the UAV be D, with a total
size of D bits. This data undergoes semantic compression. We
define the semantic compression ratio as ρ = C/D, where C
is the size of the compressed data. The computational overhead
for compression with respect to ρ is modeled as [12]
O(ρ) = −κ1D ln(ρ),
(4)
where κ1 is the coefficient representing the computation
efficiency of the semantic compression algorithm. The latency
required for semantic compression is
TU = −κ1D ln(ρ)
fU
,
(5)
where fU is the computational capacity (in cycles/s) of the
UAV’s on-board processor. The corresponding energy con-
sumption for this computation is
EU = τUf 3
UTU,
(6)
where τU is the effective switched capacitance coefficient of
the UAV’s processor.
After compression, the data is transmitted to the mobile BS.
We assume the communication channel is dominated by the
line-of-sight (LoS) path, which is a reasonable assumption for
outdoor, low-altitude scenarios.2 The channel gain between the
UAV and the BS is therefore
G(LU) = G0
dα
UB
,
(7)
where G0 is the reference channel gain at a distance of 1 m,
and α is the path-loss exponent. Using the Shannon capacity
formula, the transmission latency is
TUB =

(8)
1The locations of all network components are assumed to be static within
a single update cycle due to its short duration.
2Specifically, we model a rural environment with a path-loss exponent of
α = 2 and assume that signal power from antenna sidelobes is negligible.

where BU is the channel bandwidth, pU is the UAV’s transmit
power, and N0 is the noise power spectral density. The energy
consumed during this transmission is
EUB = pUTUB.
(9)
Upon reception, the mobile BS performs semantic recovery
to reconstruct the original data. The time and energy for this
process are modeled symmetrically to the compression phase:
TB = −κ2D ln(ρ)
fB
,
(10)
where κ2 and fB are the semantic recovery efficiency pa-
rameter and the computational capacity of the mobile BS,
respectively. The energy consumption for semantic recovery
is
EB = τBf 3
BTB.
(11)
where τB is the effective switched capacitance coefficient of
the mobile BS’s processor.
C. Control Command Generation Model
Based on the recovered information, a control command for
the robot is generated. This can occur either at the mobile BS
or be offloaded to the cloud server.
1) Case 1 (Generate at Mobile BS): The mobile BS uses
its local large AI model for inference. We model the inference
latency as being proportional to the original data size:
T I
B = κ3D
fB
,
(12)
where κ3 is the inference computation efficiency parameter.
The energy consumed for task inference by the mobile BS is
EI
B = τBf 3
BT I
B.
(13)
2) Case 2 (Generate at Cloud Server): The mobile BS
transmits the recovered data to the cloud server. The latency
required for this uplink transmission is
TBS =
D
BB log2

1 + pBGBS
BBN0
,
(14)
where BB is the bandwidth for the BS-server link, pB is the
mobile BS’s transmit power, and GBS is the corresponding
channel gain. The energy cost for this transmission is
EBS = pBTBS.
(15)
Given the substantial computational power of cloud servers,
the inference latency at the server is considered negligible.
Similarly, the server’s energy consumption is not factored into
our model as it is assumed to have a constant power supply.
To distinguish these two cases, we introduce a binary
decision variable a ∈{0, 1}. If generation is performed locally
at the mobile BS, a = 1; otherwise, a = 0.
D. Problem Formulation
The total energy consumption of the system per update cycle
is the sum of the energy consumed for UAV computation and
transmission, BS computation, and the task-dependent energy
for command generation, i.e.,
Etot = EU + EUB + EB + aEI
B + (1 −a)EBS.
(16)
Our objective is to minimize the total energy consumption
by jointly optimizing the UAV’s 3D location, the semantic
compression ratio, the transmit powers, and the command gen-
eration offloading decision. Mathematically, this optimization
problem is formulated as follows:
min

0 < pU ≤pmax
U
,
(17e)
0 < pB ≤pmax
B
,
(17f)
a ∈{0, 1}.
(17g)
Constraint (17a) imposes a maximum allowable latency, Tth,
for the entire update cycle. Constraint (17b) ensures a mini-
mum required sensing QoS, qth. The UAV’s altitude is con-
strained by (17c) to lie within a regulated range [Hmin, Hmax].
The semantic compression ratio is bounded by (17d), where
ρth is a lower limit to maintain semantic integrity. Constraints
(17e) and (17f) define the maximum transmit powers for the
UAV and mobile BS, respectively. Finally, (17g) specifies the
binary nature of the task offloading variable.
The mixed-integer non-convex problem (17) is NP-hard. In
the next section, we exploit the unique structure of problem
(17) to find its globally optimal solution via an efficient two-
dimensional search.
III. ALGORITHM DESIGN
A. Optimal UAV Location
Intuitively, to minimize both energy consumption and la-
tency, the UAV should be positioned as close as possible to
the mobile BS, subject to the operational constraints. A shorter
distance dUB enhances the channel gain, which in turn reduces
the required transmission power and time. This insight allows
us to decouple the UAV placement problem. The optimal UAV
location, L∗
U, can be found by solving the following convex
optimization problem:

the origin subject to a convex set defined by the intersection
of a sphere (representing the QoS constraint) and a slab
(representing the altitude constraint). Let Dmax =
−ln(qth)

be the maximum permissible distance from the UAV to the
moving target. Assuming feasibility, i.e., Hmin ≤Dmax, the
solution can be derived geometrically.
Theorem 1 The optimal UAV altitude is the minimum allow-
able altitude:
H∗
U = Hmin.
(19)
The optimal horizontal coordinates (x∗

U) are determined
by one of two cases:
1) Case 1 (x2

T ≤D2
max −H2
min): In this case, the
target is sufficiently close to the BS. The optimal UAV location
is directly above the BS at the minimum altitude:
L∗
U = (0, 0, Hmin).
(20)
2) Case 2 (x2
T+y2
T > D2
max−H2
min): In this case, the UAV
must move towards the target to satisfy the QoS constraint. The
optimal location lies on the edge of the cylindrical service area
in the direction of the target:

mit Power: With the optimal UAV location L∗

the subproblem for the semantic compression ratio ρ is

Theorem 2 The optimal semantic compression ratio of prob-
lem (23) is
ρ∗(pU, pB) = min {max {ρ0, ρth, ρa} , 1, ρb} ,
(24)
where ρ0 = F
A, ρa < ρb are the roots of K1ρ+K2 ln(ρ) = T.
Proof
Problem (23) admits a closed-form solution. The
unconstrained minimizer of the objective is ρ0. The latency
constraint (23a) defines a feasible interval [ρa, ρb]. These roots
can be expressed using the principal (W0) and secondary
(W−1) branches of the Lambert W function:

2: Obtain the optimal semantic compression ratio ρ∗(pU, pB)
using Theorem 2.

7: Compare V0 and V1 to determine a∗and the corresponding
optimal variables.
The optimal ρ∗is then found by projecting the unconstrained
minimizer ρ0 onto the final feasible region defined by the
intersection of [ρa, ρb] and [ρth, 1], leading to Eq. (24).
■
Crucially, Theorem 2 establishes the optimal semantic com-
pression ratio as an explicit function of the transmit powers.
2) Two-Dimensional Search on Transmit Powers: By sub-
stituting the analytical solutions for the optimal UAV location
from Theorem 1 and the optimal semantic compression ratio
from Theorem 2 back into problem (17), the original multi-
variable optimization problem is reduced to a two-dimensional
problem over the transmit powers for a fixed a:

.
(26c)
Due to the intricate form of ρ∗(pU, pB), which involves the
Lambert W function, the objective and constraint functions in
problem (26) are highly non-convex, and an analytical solution
for the optimal powers is intractable. Therefore, we find the
solution by performing a two-dimensional search over the fea-
sible power ranges. This method guarantees global optimality
for the reduced problem and remains computationally feasible.
C. Optimal Task Offloading Decision
The task offloading variable a is binary. Given that our
previous steps find the optimal solution for a fixed a, we can
determine the optimal a∗by solving the problem for each
case and selecting the one that yields a lower total energy
consumption. Let V0 and V1 be the minimum energy values
obtained from the two-dimensional search for a = 0 and
a = 1, respectively. The optimal offloading decision is:
a∗=
(
0,
if V0 < V1,
1,

The overall algorithm to solve problem (17) with global
optimality is outlined in Algorithm 1.

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS
In the simulations, the moving target is located at (300 m,
100 m, 0 m), and the UAV’s operational altitude is constrained
to [40 m, 400 m]. The maximum transmit power for both the
UAV and the mobile BS is set to 30 dBm. Unless specified
otherwise, the default parameters include a BS-server link
bandwidth of 0.5 MHz, a raw data size of 1 Mb, and a
maximum allowable latency of 700 ms.
We evaluate the performance of our proposed algo-
rithm against several benchmark schemes: Generate at the
Server/BS, which consistently offloads the task to the server
or processes it at the BS, respectively; Non-Semantic, which
transmits the raw data without any semantic compression;
Max Transmit Power, which operates the UAV and BS at
their maximum power levels; Fixed UAV Location, which
places the UAV at (xT, yT, Hmin); and BCD Algorithm,
which employs block coordinate descent (BCD) to alternately
optimize the semantic compression ratio and transmit powers.
Fig. 3 illustrates the total energy consumption as a function
of the BS-server link bandwidth, raw data size, and maxi-
mum allowable latency. Across all simulated scenarios, the
proposed algorithm consistently achieves the lowest energy
consumption, which validates its superior performance in joint
resource allocation. As depicted in the figures, the ‘Max
Transmit Power’ scheme is uniformly inefficient, underscoring
the necessity of adaptive power control. The ‘Fixed UAV
Location’ scheme exhibits a consistent performance gap,
which highlights the energy savings gained from optimizing
the UAV’s deployment. Furthermore, the ‘BCD Algorithm’
occasionally converges to a local optimum, demonstrating the
advantage of our proposed method in attaining a globally
optimal solution.
More specifically, Fig. 3(a) shows that as the BS-server
bandwidth increases, the energy cost of offloading to the
server decreases, making it the preferable strategy. Our al-
gorithm adaptively selects this optimal offloading decision,
outperforming the fixed ‘Generate at the Server/BS’ scheme.
As seen in Fig. 3(b) and Fig. 3(c), the ‘Non-Semantic’
approach performs poorly with large data sizes or stringent
latency constraints, due to the excessive energy required for
transmitting uncompressed data. This confirms the significant
efficiency gains provided by semantic communications.
V. CONCLUSION
In this letter, we designed an energy-efficient framework for
an agentic AI-assisted low-altitude semantic wireless network.
We formulated a comprehensive system-wide energy mini-
mization problem that captures the intricate trade-offs between
communication, computation, and sensing performance. By
jointly optimizing the UAV’s 3D placement, the level of
semantic compression, transmit power control, and the AI
inference task offloading, our approach aims to enhance the
operational endurance of the system. We developed an efficient
algorithm to obtain the globally optimal solution for this non-
convex optimization problem. Future research could extend
this framework to multi-UAV, multi-target scenarios, incor-
porate dynamic mobility models, and explore reinforcement
learning-based methods for real-time resource allocation in
more complex and uncertain environments.
