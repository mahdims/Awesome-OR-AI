Abstract—Clinician scheduling remains a persistent challenge 
due to limited clinical resources and fluctuating demands. This 
complexity is especially acute in large academic anesthesiology 
departments as physicians balance responsibilities across multiple 
clinical sites with conflicting priorities. Further, scheduling must 
account for individuals’ clinical and lifestyle preferences to ensure 
job satisfaction and well-being. Traditional approaches, often 
based on statistical or rule-based optimization models, rely on 
structured data and explicit domain knowledge. However, these 
methods often overlook unstructured information, e.g., free-text 
notes from routinely administered clinician well-being surveys 
and scheduling platforms. These notes may reveal implicit 
constraints (post-call recovery needs, early departures for family 
obligations) and underutilized clinical resources (a physician’s 
willingness to work additional hours to address emergent needs). 
Neglecting such information can lead to misaligned schedules, 
increased burnout, overlooked staffing flexibility, and suboptimal 
utilization of available resources. To address this gap, we propose 
a predict-then-optimize framework that integrates classification-
based clinician availability predictions with a mixed-integer 
programming schedule optimization model. Large language 
models (LLMs) are employed to extract actionable preferences 
and implicit constraints from unstructured schedule notes, 
enhancing the reliability of availability predictions. These 
predictions then inform the schedule optimization considering 
four objectives: (i) ensuring clinical full-time equivalent 
compliance, (ii) reducing workload imbalances by enforcing 
equitable proportions of shift types, (iii) maximizing clinician 
availability for assigned shifts, and (iv) schedule consistency. By 
combining the interpretive power of LLMs with the rigor of 
mathematical optimization, our framework provides a robust, 
data-driven solution that enhances operational efficiency while 
supporting equity and clinician well-being.

INTRODUCTION 
This paper addresses the problem of scheduling clinicians in 
an outpatient pain clinic, where long planning horizons, 
physician redeployments, and unanticipated absences make it 
difficult to generate fair and reliable schedules. These 
difficulties exemplify a broader challenge in clinician 
scheduling, one of the most complex problems in healthcare 
operations, where limited resources and fluctuating demand 
must be balanced against contractual obligations and individual 
preferences. In large academic anesthesiology departments, 
these pressures are especially acute, as clinicians juggle 
responsibilities across diverse clinical sites with competing 
priorities. Effective scheduling must not only ensure adequate 
coverage but also account for clinicians’ preferences to support 
job satisfaction, retention, and overall well-being [1]. Failure to 
achieve this balance can result in misaligned schedules, reduced 
workforce morale, and higher risks of burnout. 
Healthcare systems globally are facing mounting pressure 
due to rising demand, increasing costs, and changing 
reimbursement policies [2]. These pressures have intensified 
longstanding anesthesiologist and nursing shortages [3-5], 
making efficient scheduling tools essential to optimize the 
deployment of this scarce workforce [6]. Within this context, 
outpatient pain clinics affiliated with academic anesthesiology 
departments face unique scheduling challenges. Because pain 
management care is non-emergent [7], staffing for pain clinics 
is often deprioritized when anesthesiologists are needed in 
higher-acuity clinical sites, e.g.,  operating rooms (ORs) or 
intensive care units (ICUs). Additionally, the work schedules 
need 
to 
balance 
non-clinical 
duties, 
e.g., 
teaching, 
administration, and research [8]. Persistent shortages and rising 
demand exacerbate this imbalance, leading to frequent 
redeployments, appointment cancellations, and reduced patient 
access [9]. 
Further complexity arises from mismatched scheduling 
horizons, i.e., outpatient pain clinics typically plan schedules 
three months in advance, while OR and ICU schedules are set 
monthly. Even after schedules are published, clinicians may be 
redeployed to cover urgent needs elsewhere. Additional 
uncertainty arises from unanticipated absences, e.g., sick leave 
or family obligations [10]. Mitigation strategies, e.g., scheduling 
daily backup clinicians, often conflict with administrative duties 
or exceed contractual clinical full-time equivalent (cFTE) 
allocations, disrupting workload equity and further reducing 
satisfaction. 
Current practice in many clinics reflects these limitations. 
Clinician preferences entered into scheduling platforms, e.g., 
Qgenda, are often reviewed manually, inconsistently applied, or 
ignored altogether. Even when considered, they are handled case 
by case rather than systematically integrated into scheduling 
decisions. This inconsistency undermines transparency and 
equity, particularly in assigning additional compensated or 
benefit-enhanced shifts, e.g., additional services coverage.

To better utilize limited resources in the face of fluctuating 
demand and clinical resource uncertainty, data-driven 
scheduling approaches have become essential [11, 12]. These 
approaches typically rely on structured data and explicit domain 
rules, often formulated as stochastic optimization or mixed-
integer programming (MIP) models [10, 13]. While such models 
provide mathematical rigor and can enforce fairness constraints, 
e.g., cFTE allocations, equitable shift distributions, they 
frequently overlook unstructured information embedded in free-
text clinician notes, wellness surveys, and scheduling platforms. 
These sources often contain valuable implicit constraints, e.g., 
post-call recovery needs, early departure requests, or willingness 
to cover additional hours. Neglecting such information reduces 
scheduling flexibility, leads to underutilized resources, and 
increases inequities in workload distribution. 
Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have also been 
applied to clinical resource planning, primarily for forecasting 
clinical demand, e.g., patient length of stay, surgical volumes, 
emergency department arrivals, and intensive care unit 
occupancy. While these models provide valuable insights into 
expected workload, they are rarely integrated into downstream 
scheduling or staffing decisions. However, predictions remain 
descriptive rather than prescriptive, limiting their operational 
impact. Large language models (LLMs), despite their growing 
role in medical text analysis and documentation [18, 19, 20], 
remain underutilized in clinician scheduling. In particular, they 
are not yet widely employed to extract day-level availability 
constraints from scheduling notes for direct integration into 
optimization models. 
The predict-then-optimize (PTO) paradigm (also called the 
decoupled learning approach [21]) directly links predictions to 
decisions. It first predicts the unknown parameters of an 
optimization model with an ML-based predictor and then 
embeds those predictions in an optimization framework to 
produce actionable schedules. This paradigm provides a natural 
pathway for addressing outpatient clinician scheduling 
challenges. 
Building on prior work in equitable anesthesiologist 
scheduling under demand uncertainty [22], we propose a two-
step PTO clinician scheduling (PTO-CS) framework. Step 1 is 
a classification-based clinician availability prediction model 
enhanced by LLMs to better extract latent and personalized 
constraints and preferences from both structured and 
unstructured historical scheduling data (Contribution 1). Step 2 
embeds these predictions into a multi-objective MIP that (i) 
ensures compliance with cFTE allocations, (ii) reduces 
workload imbalances by enforcing equitable proportions of shift 
types, (iii) maximizes clinician availability for assigned shifts, 
and (iv) maintains schedule consistency (Contribution 2). By 
combining LLM-enhanced availability predictions with the 
prescriptive rigor of optimization, our framework provides a 
robust and scalable solution to improve efficiency, equity, and 
clinician satisfaction.  
To guide the reader, the remainder of this paper is organized 
as follows. Section II introduces the proposed PTO-CS 
framework, detailing the data sources, predictive modeling 
pipeline, and optimization formulation. Section III describes the 
experimental design and retrospective evaluation, including 
setup, metrics, and solver environment. Section IV presents the 
results, analyzing distributional deviations, match accuracy, and 
fairness outcomes across six months of clinic data. Section V 
concludes with key insights and discusses limitations and future 
directions. 
II. THE PREDICT-THEN-OPTIMIZE PARADIGM 
The PTO paradigm links predictive modeling with 
prescriptive optimization in a two-step pipeline (see Fig. 1). In 
Step 1, an ML model is trained to predict uncertain parameters 
of an optimization problem. In Step 2, these predictions are 
embedded into a mathematical programming model that 
generates actionable decisions. This structure allows data-driven 
learning to inform operational optimization. 
 
 Formally, let 𝑿 denote the feature set for each clinician–day 
pair. In our clinician scheduling application, these features 
include (i) temporal attributes (day of week, day of month, 
month, year), (ii) clinician-specific statistics (historical 
availability rates, rolling weekly and monthly availability, group 
membership), and (iii) note-derived signals extracted from free-
text scheduling comments (e.g., “Paid-time-off,” Vacation,” 
“Vacation,” “Conference,” “OR coverage”). Let Y denote the 
observed outcomes, i.e., binary clinician-day availability labels 
indicating whether a clinician was available (1) or not (0). These 
labels are refined using unstructured notes to capture exceptions 
such as illness, paid-time-off, or cross-site redeployment. The 
predictor ℎ∈𝑯 is trained by minimizing a loss function 𝐿, 
mapping features 𝑿 to observed availability outcomes 𝒀: 
The resulting predictor ℎ∗ produces estimates of uncertain 
parameters, which are then passed to the optimization step. Let 
𝑧 denote the decision variables, and let 𝑓(∙) denote the objective 
function. The optimization problem is formulated as: 
𝑧∗= arg max
𝑧
𝑓(𝑧, ℎ∗(𝑿), 𝑿), 
(2) 
subject to operational constraints. In this clinician scheduling 
application, 
ℎ∗(𝑿)
 represents 
predicted 
clinician-day 
availability (probability scores), while 𝑧∗ represents the optimal 
assignments of clinicians to shifts. 
Although PTO carries the risk that prediction errors may 
degrade optimization outcomes [23-25], problem-specific 
formulations can mitigate this sensitivity. In the proposed PTO-
CS framework, this risk is mitigated by predicting probabilistic 
clinician–day availability scores rather than exact shift 
assignments. Probabilistic inputs are more robust to uncertainty 
and directly reflect clinicians’ key priorities: compliance with

contractual cFTE requirements, equitable workload distribution, 
and fair access to diverse shift types.  
A major advantage of PTO is its modularity. Prediction and 
optimization modules can be validated independently, allowing 
stakeholders to verify intermediate outputs. This modular 
separation also ensures adaptability, i.e., advances in ML, 
particularly LLMs, can refine preference extraction, while new 
developments in optimization can improve the performance of 
the solvers and/or fairness formulations. In general, these 
features 
provide 
the 
flexibility, 
transparency, 
and 
interpretability required for adoption in real-world clinical 
scheduling practices.

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
The proposed PTO-CS framework (see Fig. 2) follows a 
PTO paradigm with two steps. In Step 1 (prediction), structured 
scheduling data and unstructured notes are transformed into 
calibrated clinician-day availability probabilities. In Step 2 
(optimization), these probabilities are embedded into a multi-
objective MIP that (i) ensures compliance with cFTE 
allocations, (ii) enforces equitable proportions of shift types, 
(iii) maximizes clinician availability for assigned shifts, and 
(iv) maintains schedule consistency. This modular design 
separates 
learning 
from 
decision-making, 
ensuring 
transparency and adaptability. 
A. Data Simulation and Preprocessing 
The dataset for this study was constructed from synthetic 
schedule templates enriched with LLM-generated notes, 
covering the period March 2021 through September 2024, to 
emulate the scheduling environment of the outpatient pain 
clinic. 
Each month, an anonymous schedule template was produced 
by a month-by-month optimization model developed under 
requirements specified by the clinical informatics team. 
Clinician identifiers were masked as clinician IDs to ensure de-
identification. The templates encoded institutional, operational, 
and individualized requirements supplied by the scheduling 
team, including coverage rules, workload distributions, and 
clinician-specific preferences. Designed to be compatible with 
commonly used scheduling platforms (e.g., Qgenda), these 
templates were also embedded in the scheduling processes at the 
concerned outpatient clinic. As a result, the templates provide a 
rich representation of real-world scheduling practices, balancing 
institutional/clinical policies with clinician-level preferences 
and constraints. 
Although actual operations often introduce modifications 
(e.g., last-minute changes, urgent swaps, part-time call-ins), in 
this study, the monthly templates serve as proxies for historical 
schedules, providing a consistent clinician-day grid that reflects 
institutional intent. Each scheduled clinician-day pair is labeled 
as available, while non-scheduled pairs are labeled as not 
available after excluding weekends, holidays, and site-specific 
blackout days. 
To simulate the unstructured component of scheduling data, 
LLMs external to the PTO-CS framework generated synthetic 
free-text comments. 10% of assigned shifts were randomly 
selected and annotated with plausible, contextually relevant 
notes (e.g., “paid-time-off,” “Vacation,” “Interview Day,” 
“Conference,” “Covering OR”), along with more natural, free-
form requests and remarks consistent with clinical practice. This 
sampling rate reflects the typical frequency of annotation in 
operational scheduling systems, ensuring variability while 
preserving realism. By design, these notes inject implicit 
constraints and contextual information that structured templates 
alone do not capture. 
From the structured schedules, we engineered temporal and 
clinician-specific features, including day of week, day of month, 
month, year, weekly availability rate, monthly availability rate, 
and weekday-specific availability rates. These features were 
merged with availability labels and simulated note annotations 
to form a consolidated modeling dataset, with one row per 
clinician-day. 
The resulting dataset integrates synthetic scheduling data 
consisting of structured schedules and unstructured free-text 
scheduling notes and comments, establishing a realistic and 
auditable foundation for predictive modeling and downstream 
optimization. This dataset ensures alignment with operational

practice and supports the practical applicability of the proposed 
PTO-CS framework. 
B. Step 1: LLM-Enhanced Availability Prediction Model 
Step 1 of the PTO-CS framework is a classification-based 
clinician availability prediction model enhanced with LLMs. 
While structured historical schedules capture the shift 
assignments, they do not always reflect actual availability. One-
day exceptions, e.g., paid-time-off, illness, interview days, or 
cross-site coverage, appear only in unstructured free-text 
scheduling notes. Ignoring these notes introduces label noise, 
leading to overstated availability on conflict days and 
understated availability on others. Such miscalibration 
propagates into the prediction stage, undermining fairness, 
coverage, and workload balance in downstream scheduling. 
To address this limitation, we combine a supervised, 
classification-based availability prediction model trained on 
structured features with an LLM-based note reader. The LLM 
strengthens availability prediction in two complementary ways: 
(i) by refining historical training labels through the extraction of 
conflicts and preferences from past notes, and (ii) by correcting 
future predictions when advance scheduling requests explicitly 
signal availability or unavailability. Together, these components 
ensure that predictions incorporate both structured scheduling 
patterns and contextual constraints, providing cleaner, more 
reliable inputs to the optimization stage. 
1) LLM-Driven Labels 
Unstructured scheduling notes often contain the real reason 
a clinician can or cannot work on a given day (e.g., paid-time-
off, illness, conference, cross-site coverage, OR duty). To 
capture this information systematically, we employ a small, 
locally deployed instruction-tuned language model (Google 
FLAN-T5 base [26]) to convert notes into binary, auditable 
availability signals. These signals serve two purposes: (i) 
improving training labels for historical data, and (ii) refining 
probability estimates for upcoming schedules. FLAN-T5 is 
chosen because it handles short instruction-style prompts 
reliably, runs efficiently on standard hardware, and produces 
stable outputs without reliance on external APIs. Running 
locally also ensures privacy, reproducibility, and low cost. 
Given that notes are brief and map naturally to a two-label space, 
larger models would add little benefit relative to their higher 
computational costs. FLAN-T5 offers a balanced trade-off 
between accuracy, latency, and interpretability. 
Formally, let 𝑖 index clinician and 𝑡 index the date. From 
the structured schedule, we extract a binary label 𝑦𝑖,𝑡
𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑐𝑡∈
{0, 1}, where 1=available and 0=not available. When a schedule 
note exists for (𝑖, 𝑡), the LLM outputs a binary signal 𝑙𝑖,𝑡∈
{0, 1} with the same semantics. Overtime-related comments 
(e.g., “Overtime,” “stayed late,” “extended clinic”) are mapped 
to 𝑙𝑖,𝑡= 1 , while conflicts (e.g., paid-time-off, illness, 
conference, or cross-site duties) are mapped to 𝑙𝑖,𝑡= 0 . If 
multiple comments exist, explicit conflicts take precedence; 
otherwise, the most recent non-conflict note is retained. All 
inferences run locally, and each decision is logged in a 
machine-readable audit trail that records the normalized text, 
matched rationale, and final label. 
The final alignment signal is obtained by combining 
schedule and comment labels with a conservative rule as 
follows: 
This ensures that explicit unavailability overrides the 
schedule, while neutral or positive notes leave the original 
schedule unchanged. In the subsequent probability model, we 
apply the same conservative rule, i.e., probabilities are hard 
zeroed when comments indicate unavailability; otherwise, the 
calibrated baseline is preserved. This rule reduces false 
positives on conflict days, maintains calibrated nuance 
elsewhere, and integrates seamlessly into existing scheduling 
workflows without altering clinic rules. 
2) Classification-based Models  
Before integrating LLM-derived labels, we benchmarked 
supervised classifiers trained solely on structured scheduling 
features. These features, engineered from common scheduling 
platform records, include temporal attributes (day-of-week, 
day-of-month, month, year) and clinician-specific statistics 
(historical availability, rolling weekly and monthly availability 
rates, and clinician-group indicators). The goal is to estimate 
the probability that a clinician 𝑖 would be available on a given 
day 𝑡, producing calibrated probabilities suitable for 
downstream work schedule optimization. 
Our primary estimator is logistic regression, selected for its 
interpretability and probabilistic outputs. Formally, let 𝑎𝑖,𝑡∈
{0, 1} denote the day-level availability indicator and 𝑿𝑖,𝑡∈ℝ𝐾 
the engineered feature vector with 𝐾 features. The probability of 
availability from the logistic regression classifier is formulated 
as follows: 
where 𝜎(𝜂) =
1
1+𝑒−𝜂 is the logistic function, 𝛽0 is the intercept, 
and 𝛽∈ℝ𝐾 is the coefficient vector. This benchmark 
evaluation respected temporal order: using forward-chaining 
validation [27], we trained on earlier months and validated on 
later ones, following how scheduling decisions are made in 
practice. Class imbalance across the full clinician-day grid was 
addressed through resampling, and probability calibration 
ensured that predicted probabilities corresponded to actual 
availability rates. Specifically, month-ahead calibration was 
performed by learning a mapping between raw predictions and 
observed outcomes in the immediately following month. For 
each month, predicted probabilities were grouped into bins, the 
empirical availability frequency within each bin was computed, 
and these frequencies were then used to adjust subsequent 
predictions. This rolling calibration procedure avoided temporal 
leakage while aligning predicted probabilities with real-world 
availability patterns. Logistic regression achieved strong 
operational performance, with Accuracy=0.78, Recall for the 
available class=0.85, and Macro-F1=0.78 (Table I). The high 
recall reduced missed staffing opportunities, and the calibrated 
probabilities were stable month-to-month, making this model 
both reliable and auditable for clinical partners.

To benchmark against nonlinear alternatives, we also 
evaluated decision trees and random forests. The decision tree 
model recursively partitioned the feature space to capture 
threshold and interaction effects that a linear model might miss 
(e.g., “Fridays in July for Group A”). With controlled depth and 
pruning by default, the tree achieved Accuracy=0.79, Precision 
for the available class=0.83, Recall=0.75, and Macro-F=0.79. 
Although interpretable, single trees were less stable across 
months and required post-hoc calibration for probability 
estimates. 
The random forest model, which averages many 
decorrelated trees, achieved the highest overall Accuracy=0.80 
and Macro-F1=0.79. It generalized well across clinicians and 
seasons, but its raw probability outputs were miscalibrated, and 
the model is not as interpretable as logistic regression or single 
trees. 
In summary, structured-only baselines reflected the classic 
trade-off between interpretability and accuracy. Logistic 
regression offered competitive accuracy with the strongest recall 
for the available class, decision trees captured nonlinear rules at 
the cost of stability, and random forests improved overall 
accuracy while reducing transparency. Taken together, these 
results supported the use of logistic regression as the default 
baseline 𝑝𝑖,𝑡
𝐶.  
In the next subsection, we extend this baseline by integrating 
note-derived signals from the LLM, ensuring that explicit 
conflicts override structured predictions and yielding a single 
auditable probability for Step 2 of the PTO-CS framework. 
3) Integrating LLM Models and Classifiers 
Step 1 of the PTO-CS framework culminates in an LLM–
enhanced availability prediction model that integrates structured 
classification-based probabilities with contextual corrections 
derived from unstructured scheduling notes. The process 
unfolded in three sequential stages: 
Temporal Segregation: LLM-extracted labels from past 
notes are merged with structured schedule features (e.g., day-of-
week, rolling availability, clinician group) to generate refined 
training data. This integration reduces label noise introduced 
when exceptions such as paid-time-off or cross-site coverage are 
ignored, yielding more accurate historical availability baselines. 
Probabilistic Estimation: Classification models, led by 
logistic regression with calibrated outputs, generate baseline 
probabilities of clinician availability for future days. E.g., the 
model may estimate that clinician 𝑖 has a 92% probability of 
being available on Week 2, Day 3, based on temporal and 
historical scheduling patterns, which serves as the baseline 
availability probability. 
LLM-Guided Correction: For future schedules, clinicians 
often submit notes alongside their requests (e.g., “Interview 
Day,” “Vacation,” “Conference,” or “OR coverage”). The LLM 
processes these notes and, when they explicitly indicate 
unavailability, the corresponding probability is hard-set to zero. 
Otherwise, the baseline probability is retained. This 
conservative adjustment enforces deterministic corrections 
where textual evidence is clear while preserving probabilistic 
nuance elsewhere. 
This three-stage design ensures that the model retains 
probabilistic richness when structured features and notes align, 
while enforcing strict corrections when conflicts are explicitly 
documented. By combining the structured regularities captured 
by logistic regression with the contextual awareness of FLAN-
T5, the LLM–enhanced availability prediction model balances 
interpretability, adaptability, and predictive accuracy, resulting 
in availability estimates that are robust, transparent, and 
operationally actionable. 
Formally, the final probability is refined conservatively as 
follows: 
This formulation hard-zeros availability when notes clearly 
indicate a conflict, while leaving the calibrated baseline 
unchanged in all other cases. The result is a single, auditable 
probability estimate that reduces false positives on conflict days, 
preserves calibrated probabilities elsewhere, and integrates 
seamlessly into existing scheduling workflows without altering 
institutional rules. 
C. Step 2: Optimization-Based Schedule Generation 
Step 2 of the PTO-CS framework embeds the LLM–
enhanced availability predictions from Step 1 into a multi-
objective MIP model that produces operational schedules. While 
Step 1 refines probabilistic estimates of clinician availability, 
Step 2 transforms these signals into optimized schedules that 
account for institutional requirements, workload balance, and 
clinician-level fairness. 
1) Decision Variables 
Let 𝑰 denote the set of clinicians, 𝑺 the set of shift types, and 
𝑫 the set of days in the scheduling horizon. The binary decision 
variable is defined as: 
Each clinician-day pair is associated with a probabilistic 
availability estimate 𝑝𝑖,𝑡∈[0,1]  derived in Step 1. This 
probability is not a decision variable but informs assignment 
feasibility and objective weighting.

the average share 𝐵̅𝑠 is minimized. Objective (9) maximizes 
alignment between assignments and predicted availability. 
Objective (10) seeks schedule consistency by minimizing 
disruptive changes relative to the prior schedule 𝐵𝑖,𝑠,𝑡
𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑣. 
3) Constraints 
Constraints of Step 2 model are listed in (11)–(15) in the 
following: 
Constraints (11) ensure that the total number of clinicians 
assigned to each shift matches demand, where 𝑟𝑠,𝑡 is the required 
staffing level. Constraints (12) ensure each clinician may work 
at most one shift per day. Constraints (13) are the workload 
bounds constraints, which ensure the total number of shifts 
assigned to each clinician is within a predefined range [𝐿𝑖, 𝑈𝑖], 
where 𝐿𝑖 and 𝑈𝑖 are the lower and upper bounds for clinician 𝑖. 
These bounds enforce fairness and ensure compliance with 
contractual workload agreements. Constraints (14) ensure that 
assignments must also respect hard availability restrictions 
derived from Step 1, where 𝑎̅𝑖,𝑡∈{0,1} is the hard availability 
indicator. Constraints (15) ensure institution-specific policies, 
e.g., limits on weekend or night duties, are encoded, where 
𝐷𝑤𝑘𝑒𝑛𝑑 is the set of weekend days and 𝑊𝑖 is the allowable 
weekend workload for clinician 𝑖.  
4) Solution Method: Lexicographic Goal Programming 
The optimization problem in Step 2 integrates four 
conflicting objectives. Because these objectives cannot 
generally be optimized simultaneously without trade-offs, a 
lexicographic goal programming approach is adopted to balance 
competing requirements. 
In lexicographic goal programming, each objective is 
reformulated as a goal with a specified aspiration level 𝑔𝑘. 
Deviational variables 𝑑𝑘
− and 𝑑𝑘
+  measure under- and over-
achievement relative to the target. The model then minimizes a 
weighted sum of these deviations: 
where 𝜆𝑘 represents the relative priority weight assigned to each 
goal. In the PTO-CS framework, the priorities are defined as: 
Goal 1: cFTE Compliance. Ensuring that each clinician’s 
total number of assigned shifts matches their contractual cFTE 
level is treated as the highest-priority requirement. Any 
deviation from this allocation is minimized before addressing 
other objectives. 
Goal 2: Equitable Shift Type Proportions. Given cFTE 
compliance, the model seeks to distribute different shift types 
equitably across clinicians. Deviations capture imbalances, 
particularly in undesirable or high-burden shifts. 
Goal 3: Availability Maximization. Subject to Goals 1 and 
2, schedules are optimized to maximize alignment with 
predicted availability probabilities 𝑝𝑖,𝑡, reducing the likelihood 
of infeasible or last-minute changes. 
Goal 4: Schedule Consistency. Finally, consistency with the 
previous month’s schedule is enforced to the extent possible, 
minimizing disruptive changes while respecting higher-priority 
goals. 
This lexicographic structure reflects clinical and institutional 
priorities: contractual cFTE obligations must be satisfied first, 
equitable distribution of shift types is preserved to reduce 
workload disparities, and predicted availability is leveraged to 
mitigate uncertainty in clinical resources. Consistency with prior 
schedules is incorporated as a secondary objective, recognizing 
its value for clinician satisfaction while ensuring it does not 
override fairness or compliance. By adopting this formulation, 
PTO-CS produces schedules that are feasible, policy-compliant, 
equitable, and robust to variability in clinician availability, while 
limiting unnecessary disruptions to clinicians’ work patterns. 
IV. 
EVALUATION AND RESULTS 
A. Evaluation Setup and Metrics 
We evaluated the proposed PTO-CS framework using 
realistic synthetic outpatient pain clinic scheduling data with 
schedule comments as described in Section III. For evaluation 
purposes, this dataset was treated as historical (actual) 
schedules, against which optimized schedules generated by 
PTO-CS were compared. 
The evaluation period spanned six consecutive months, i.e., 
from March 2024 to August 2024. This timeframe was selected 
for two main reasons. First, it contains seasonal diversity in 
scheduling patterns, including the transition from the academic 
spring semester into summer. During this period, clinician 
availability is affected by increased clinical duties, vacations, 
and professional conferences. Importantly, as part of an 
academic anesthesiology department, schedules are also 
influenced by new residents beginning rotations in July. More 
experienced faculty, often holding dual appointments in both the 
OR and the outpatient clinic, are more likely to be redeployed to 
high-acuity sites (e.g., ORs) when resident staffing is relatively 
less experienced. Second, this window offered stability in 
clinical scheduling operations, as scheduling processes and 
templates had been standardized earlier in the year, ensuring 
consistent data quality since the synthetic data is based on 
historical schedule templates. Overall, this six-month window 
reflects a mix of routine and high-variability conditions while 
operations remained stable, providing a natural stress test for 
PTO-CS. Section IV-C and Fig. 3 report the month-by-month 
results.

The evaluation followed a two-level design. At the 
distributional level, we compared clinician counts per shift type 
on each and across the schedule horizon for both optimized and 
historical schedules. The analysis emphasized two core shift 
types, i.e., Clinic (Clin) and Procedure (Proc), which served as 
proxies for clinical coverage compliance and cFTE allocation 
fairness. At the instance level, we conducted day-by-day 
clinician–day comparisons. An assignment was considered a 
match if the same clinician was scheduled to work on that day 
in both the optimized and historical schedules, regardless of the 
specific shift type; otherwise, it was treated as a mismatch. 
Match accuracy, expressed as the percentage of clinician–day 
matches, was used as an indicator of operational alignment 
rather than predictive accuracy in the machine learning sense. 
Optimization experiments were conducted in Python 3.13, 
with models solved using Gurobi 11.0 on a workstation (Intel 
Core i7-14700, 32 GB RAM). Prediction baselines (logistic 
regression, decision tree, random forest) and the LLM-enhanced 
availability predictor were implemented in Python (scikit-learn). 
The note-classification module employed a locally deployed 
Google FLAN-T5 base model, ensuring reproducibility, 
privacy-preserving 
inference, 
and 
seamless 
prediction–
optimization integration.

C. Results and Interpretation 
The performance of PTO-CS is evaluated using the four 
KPIs described above and compared against historical 
scheduling practices over a six-month horizon (March–August 
2024). Monthly results were consistent across the window. 
Coverage rate performance is summarized in Fig. 3. 
Historical schedules showed incomplete coverage in multiple 
months, with Clin shift coverage ranging from 0.77 (April) to 
0.97 (March) and Proc shift coverage ranging from 0.68 
(August) to 1.0 (April). In contrast, PTO-CS consistently 
achieved 100% coverage for both Clin and Proc shifts across all 
six months. These results confirm that the optimization 
framework effectively enforced coverage constraints (Eq. (11)), 
ensuring all required shifts were filled regardless of seasonal 
fluctuations in clinician availability. 
 
 
Shift-type proportional equity results are summarized in Fig. 
4. Historical schedules exhibited higher variance in clinician-
level allocations, indicating workload imbalances across both 
Clin and Proc shifts. E.g., variance in Proc assignments reached 
0.134 in March and remained elevated in April (0.048) and May 
(0.044). By contrast, PTO-CS consistently reduced variance, 
with Proc shift proportions ranging from 0.005 to 0.034 across 
all months. Clinic shift allocations showed a similar pattern, i.e., 
historical variance peaked at 0.063 in March, whereas PTO-CS 
reduced this to below 0.009 in most months. 
Overall, PTO-CS produced substantially more balanced 
distributions of both Clin and Proc shifts across clinicians. These 
improvements demonstrate that the framework effectively 
addressed proportional equity objectives, ensuring fairer 
allocation of workload compared with historical scheduling 
practices.

cFTE compliance and schedule accuracy results are shown 
in Fig. 5. Historical schedules demonstrated substantial 
misalignment with contractual cFTEs, with total cFTE 
deviations ranging from 0.45 (March) to 1.25 (April). In 
contrast, PTO-CS reduced misalignment to between 0.15 and 
0.32, representing a marked improvement in aligning clinician 
assignments with contractual obligations. 
 
Schedule accuracy for PTO-CS, measured as clinician–day 
alignment with historical schedules, ranged from 68.8% (April) 
to 77.4% (July). Accuracy was lower in months where fairness 
and coverage constraints were binding (e.g., April and June) but 
improved when clinician workloads were more flexible. These 
results illustrate the intended trade-off in the lexicographic 
optimization, i.e., reductions in match accuracy were offset by 
significant improvements in fairness and compliance with 
contractual cFTE levels. 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  
In this work, PTO-CS, a predict-then-optimize framework 
for outpatient clinician scheduling, is developed and evaluated. 
By combining LLM-enhanced availability predictions with 
multi-objective optimization, the PTO-CS achieves full 
coverage, improves workload fairness by enforcing an equitable 
proportion of shift types, and ensures compliance with 
contractual cFTE allocations benchmarked against historical 
schedules. The lower assignment match accuracy, i.e., 
comparing PTO-CS generated schedules with realistic historical 
schedule templates, reflects intentional reallocations to prioritize 
fairness and compliance, highlighting the trade-offs inherent in 
lexicographic optimization. The PTO-CS framework builds on 
prior consultations with the concerned outpatient pain clinic and 
its scheduling team, ensuring alignment with day-to-day 
operations and established workflows. This grounding in 
clinical practice enhances ease of adoption and underscores its 
potential for real-world deployment and measurable impact on 
clinical operations. 
Several important limitations highlight directions for future 
work. First, the current application of LLMs was intentionally 
conservative, limited to extracting explicit conflicts (e.g., paid-
time-off, illness, cross-site coverage) and mapping them to 
availability restrictions. While this approach improved baseline 
predictions, it underutilized the broader potential of LLMs. In 
addition, the fine-tuned FLAN-T5 model was selected for its 
efficiency, ease of deployment on standard hardware, and ability 
to run locally (addressing data safety concerns), which made it 
a practical choice for early-stage testing and proof of concept. 
Building on this foundation, future work will investigate 
alternative LLM architectures and fine-tuning strategies to 
improve the accuracy of extracting conflicts and overtime 
indicators. Furthermore, expanding the role of LLMs to capture 
nuanced preferences, partial availability (e.g., availability for 
two hours beyond a regular shift), and contextual signals beyond 
binary overrides represents a promising avenue for improving 
the practical value of this work. 
Second, the PTO-CS is evaluated on realistic, close-to-final 
schedule templates augmented with synthetic LLM-generated 
notes. Future work will proceed along two complementary 
directions. On one hand, we will develop a rigorous LLM-based 
schedule note simulation tool to better mimic the density and 
variability of real scheduling notes. Since clinicians may or may 
not choose to leave notes, this tool will allow us to 
systematically assess how the performance of PTO-CS varies 
under different levels of note density. Additionally, we will 
establish benchmarks for LLM-based conflict extraction to 
evaluate reliability and quantify misclassification risks. On the 
other hand, access to real scheduling records will be essential to 
measure the framework’s practical impact on clinical 
operations. We are actively collaborating with clinical partners 
to adapt PTO-CS to operational workflows and to validate it 
prospectively on authentic scheduling documents and notes. 
Third, future work will also expand schedule performance 
evaluation beyond operational metrics, e.g., coverage, fairness, 
and workload compliance, to include downstream outcomes, 
e.g., patient access, quality of care, clinician well-being, and 
fatigue. While the six-month evaluation window captured both 
routine and high-variability conditions, longer-term studies are 
needed to assess cumulative impacts, e.g., fatigue and burnout. 
Methodologically, the current optimization relied on a fixed 
lexicographic priority structure. Exploring alternative multi-
objective solution approaches, e.g., ε-constraint methods or 
interactive procedures [28], could provide decision makers with 
greater flexibility. Moreover, the decoupled predict-then-
optimize paradigm introduces risks of error propagation and 
misalignment between prediction 
and 
decision-making. 
Addressing these challenges through integrated joint prediction-
and-optimization approaches [29] that integrate predictive 
modeling with scheduling objectives represents an important 
future direction. 
In summary, PTO-CS offers a transparent, modular, and 
scalable approach to clinician scheduling that balances fairness, 
coverage, and workload compliance. With enhanced use of 
LLMs, real-world validation, and methodological refinements, 
the framework has the potential to reduce scheduler burden, 
improve workload equity, and support sustainable clinical 
operations in diverse healthcare settings.
