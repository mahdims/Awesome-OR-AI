Under Uncertain Inference Time

Abstract—In edge intelligence systems, deep neural network
(DNN) partitioning and data ofﬂoading can provide real-time
task inference for resource-constrained mobile devices. However,
the inference time of DNNs is typically uncertain and can-
not be precisely determined in advance, presenting signiﬁcant
challenges in ensuring timely task processing within deadlines.
To address the uncertain inference time, we propose a robust
optimization scheme to minimize the total energy consumption
of mobile devices while meeting task probabilistic deadlines. The
scheme only requires the mean and variance information of the
inference time, without any prediction methods or distribution
functions. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlin-
ear programming (MINLP) that involves jointly optimizing the
DNN model partitioning and the allocation of local CPU/GPU
frequencies and uplink bandwidth. To tackle the problem, we
ﬁrst decompose the original problem into two subproblems:
resource allocation and DNN model partitioning. Subsequently,
the two subproblems with probability constraints are equivalently
transformed into deterministic optimization problems using the
chance-constrained programming (CCP) method. Finally, the
convex optimization technique and the penalty convex-concave
procedure (PCCP) technique are employed to obtain the optimal
solution of the resource allocation subproblem and a stationary
point of the DNN model partitioning subproblem, respectively.
The proposed algorithm leverages real-world data from popular
hardware platforms and is evaluated on widely used DNN models.
Extensive simulations show that our proposed algorithm effec-
tively addresses the inference time uncertainty with probabilistic
deadline guarantees while minimizing the energy consumption of
mobile devices.

I. INTRODUCTION

EEP neural networks (DNNs) have been extensively
applied across various innovative applications, including
speech recognition [1], object detection [2], image segmenta-
tion [3], etc. With the penetration of these applications, there
is a critical demand to deploy DNN models on mobile devices
with limited computing capacity and battery power, such
as energy-harvesting sensors, micro-robots, and unmanned

aerial vehicles, to achieve real-time task inference and intelli-
gent decision-making. However, these DNN models usually
have high computing capacity requirements. For example,
GoogleNet, ResNet101, and VGG16 require 3.0, 15.2, and
31.0 giga ﬂoating point of operations (GFLOPs), respectively
[4]. On the Raspberry Pi platform, the inference time of
GoogleNet is about 0.8 seconds [5], while for tiny YOLOv2, it
is up to 1.8 seconds [6]. Due to the disparity between the high
computing capacity requirements of DNNs and the resource-
limited mobile devices, achieving fast task inference on these
mobile devices is highly challenging.
To address this challenge, edge-device collaborative infer-
ence has recently been proposed [6], [7]. The key idea of
edge-device collaborative inference is to adaptively partition
the DNN model in response to varying channel states, thereby
achieving an efﬁcient balance of the inference computing
capacity and transmission data size between mobile devices
and the edge server. This facilitates the coordination of timely
task inference between weak mobile devices and the powerful
edge server. The important objective of collaborative inference
is to determine the optimal partitioning point and allocate
communication and computation resources, ensuring that the
inference results meet task deadlines and enabling the timely
processing of subsequent tasks. However, most existing work
on collaborative inference assumes that the inference time of
a task is precisely known, overlooking the impact of inference
time uncertainty on collaborative inference [8], [9], [10], [11],
[12], [13], [14], [15].
In practical systems, the inference time of DNNs is variable
and uncertain, and it cannot be determined until the inference
task is executed [16], [17]. In [16], the authors assess the
inference time of convolutional neural networks on the SoCs,
observing signiﬁcant performance variations under inference
time outliers. In [17], the authors observe that the inference
time of various DNN models applied to autonomous driving
are uncertain, and analyze several factors that inﬂuence the
ﬂuctuations in DNN inference time. Different from the object
detection tasks in [17], we verify the variations in inference
time of several DNN models for the classiﬁcation task on
the CIFAR-10 dataset using the CPU and GPU platforms,
as shown in Fig. 1. We also ﬁnd that the uncertainty of
DNN inference time is affected by the model structure, I/O
speed, hardware platform, etc. Moreover, it can be observed
from Fig. 1 that the inference time of different models
on different hardware exhibits signiﬁcant randomness, which
makes its distribution function difﬁcult to obtain accurately.
Indeed, uncertain inference time brings a signiﬁcant challenge

to edge-device collaboration. It is well known that deciding
DNN model partitioning based on worst-case inference time
tends to be overly conservative, and extending task deadlines
can compromise the timeliness of the system. Therefore, it
is necessary to consider the robust DNN partitioning and
resource allocation to provide performance guarantees.
In this paper, we address the issue of uncertain inference
time in DNN model partitioning and resource allocation by
providing probabilistic guarantees on deadlines. In this way,
inference time is not strictly bound by hard deadlines; rather,
occasional violations of task deadlines are tolerated. This
approach is deemed reasonable in practical systems. For image
or video processing, occasional violations of deadlines can be
mitigated through error control techniques at the application
layer [33]. Speciﬁcally, we allow the probability of task
execution time (consisting of local inference, uplink transmis-
sion, and edge inference delays) violating the task deadline
to remain under a predeﬁned threshold while minimizing
the total energy consumption of mobile devices. Considering
that the accurate inference time cannot be obtained and its
distribution function is difﬁcult to characterize, we design a
robust DNN partitioning, uplink bandwidth, and computing
resource allocation policy, utilizing only the mean and variance
information of the inference time. The main contributions of
this work are summarized below.
• To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work explic-
itly considering inference time uncertainty in optimizing
DNN partitioning. To this end, we formulate a joint
optimization problem involving the DNN model parti-
tioning and the allocation of local CPU/GPU frequencies
and uplink bandwidth under uncertain inference time,
aiming to minimize the expected energy consumption of
all mobile devices while meeting probabilistic deadline
constraints. Due to the probabilistic deadline constraints
arising from uncertain inference time and the combina-
torial nature of DNN model partitioning and resource
allocation decisions, the problem is a challenging mixed-
integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem.
• Considering that DNN inference time cannot be precisely
determined a priori and its probabilistic distribution
is difﬁcult to estimate accurately, we characterize the
mean and variance of the inference time across different
CPU/GPU frequencies based on real-world data from
DNN models. Speciﬁcally, the nonlinear least squares
method is used to ﬁt a function that describes the rela-
tionship between the mean inference time and CPU/GPU
frequency. Then, we present an efﬁcient method for
estimating the variance and covariance of the inference
time across different CPU/GPU frequencies.
• To deal with the combinatorial nature of the MINLP
problem, we ﬁrst propose decomposing the original prob-
lem into a resource allocation subproblem with ﬁxed
partitioning decisions and a DNN model partitioning sub-
problem that optimizes the expected energy consumption
corresponding to the resource allocation problem. Then,
the two subproblems with probabilistic constraints are
equivalently transformed into deterministic optimization
problems using the mean and variance information of
inference time and the chance-constrained programming
(CCP) method.
• Finally, we obtain the optimal solution to uplink band-
width and the CPU/GPU frequencies of the resource
allocation subproblem using the convex optimization
technique. By exploring the structural properties of the
DNN model partitioning subproblem, a stationary point
of the problem is obtained using the penalty convex-
concave procedure (PCCP) method. The PCCP method
has low computational complexity and can achieve the
near-optimal solution in polynomial time.
Simulations are carried out on real-world data from Nvidia
hardware platforms and are evaluated on widely used DNN
models. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that
the proposed robust policy exhibits faster convergence and
lower computational complexity. The simulation results show
that the probability guarantee of the task deadline can be
successfully achieved under DNN inference time uncertainty,
which means that the proposed policy is more robust. Com-
pared to the state-of-the-art approach, our proposed policy has
a signiﬁcant improvement in energy saving on mobile devices.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section
II reviews related work. Section III describes the system
model and problem formulation. Section IV derives the mean
and variance of inference time. Section V develops a robust
DNN partitioning and resource allocation algorithm. Section
VI shows the simulation results, followed by the conclusion
in Section VII.
II. RELATED WORK
In this section, we summarize the existing work on DNN
model partitioning and resource allocation, and introduce the
work related to inference time uncertainty.
A. DNN Model Partitioning
Extensive research focuses on DNN model partitioning
and resource allocation in collaboration inference. Various

works are investigated from different perspectives, such as
collaborative paradigms, DNN model structures, and inference
approaches. The cloud-end collaboration paradigm partially
shifts DNN inference from the device to the cloud [7], [18].
In [7], the neurosurgeon algorithm is proposed to ﬁnd an
intermediate partitioning point in the DNN model, keeping
the front-end model on the device and ofﬂoading the back-
end model to the cloud. Leveraging a similar principle, [18]
proposes a distributed partitioning strategy that divides the
DNN model into the cloud, the edge server, and the end
devices. To reduce the latency of cloud inference, the edge-
end collaboration paradigm is studied [5], [15]. Edgent [5]
utilizes mobile edge computing (MEC) for DNN collaborative
inference through device-edge synergy by adaptive partitioning
and right-sizing DNNs to reduce latency. Based on [5], [15]
proposes a learning-based method that optimizes DNN par-
titioning, early exit point selection, and computing resource
allocation. [45] proposes an integrated sensing, computing,
and communication (ISCC) architecture that jointly optimizes
AI model partitioning, as well as integrated sensing and
communication, to deliver low-latency intelligent services at
the network edge.
Different DNNs may have various structures, so a suitable
model structure is needed for effective partitioning. Therefore,
[6] and [14] use the directed acyclic graph (DAG) to model
the relationship between layers in DNN, and transform the
DNN partitioning problem into the solution of the minimum
cut problem in graph theory. To reduce the complexity of
DAG modeling, [10] and [19] divide the DAG into multiple
blocks, thereby simplifying the DNN model into a block-based
chain structure. The above studies generally adopt a sequence
inference approach, where local inference is before the par-
titioning point and edge inference is behind the partitioning
point. Unlike sequence inference, a few works investigate
parallel and batch inference approaches. Taking advantage
of the parallelism of the input sequence, [20] partitions the
transformer model according to location to accelerate the
inference speed. [12] considers appropriate partitioning point
selection, aggregates multiple inference tasks into one batch,
and processes them concurrently on the edge server. However,
most of these studies assume that the inference time of DNNs
is deterministic and known in advance.
B. Inference Time Uncertainty
A few works that focus on the inference time uncertainty
[16], [17], [21], [22]. In [16] and [17], the authors discover
earlier the uncertainty in inference time and analyze the causes
of inference time uncertainty. [16] evaluates the inference time
performance of convolutional neural networks on multiple
generations of iPhone SoC chips, observing signiﬁcant per-
formance variations through numerous outliers. The analysis
shows that the inference time, particularly on the A11 chip,
follows an approximately Gaussian distribution. [17] observes
that the inference time of various DNN models applied to
autonomous driving is uncertain, and the inﬂuence on the
inference time ﬂuctuation is analyzed from six aspects: data,
I/O, model, runtime, hardware, and end-to-end perception

system. Uncertainty in inference time brings a signiﬁcant
challenge to time-critical tasks. To address this challenge, [21]
designs a kernel-based prediction method to estimate DNN
inference time on different devices, addressing the issue of
not being able to obtain inference time a priori. [22] develops
a method to estimate end-to-end inference time by training
machine learning models to predict the time of each neural
architecture component with limited proﬁling data and across
different machine learning frameworks.
However, inference time exhibits signiﬁcant randomness
across different DNN models and hardware platforms, and
the prediction methods proposed by [21] and [22] have not
satisﬁed the requirements of high precision. The above studies
do not involve the impact of computing resources on inference
time and uncertainty, nor do they consider DNN partitioning
decisions under inference time uncertainty. In this paper, our
goal is to jointly optimize DNN model partitioning and the
allocation of computing and communication resources to min-
imize energy consumption on mobile devices while satisfying
probabilistic task deadlines. To the best of our knowledge, this
issue has not been explored in the context of DNN partitioning.
III. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION
As illustrated in Fig. 2, we consider a multi-device edge in-
telligence system consisting of N mobile devices, represented
by the set N ≜{1, . . ., N}, and one edge node integrated
with an MEC server, where the mobile devices and the edge
node only have one single antenna. The Frequency Division
Multiple Access (FDMA) system is considered, where the
channel interference between mobile devices can be negligible.
We consider that each mobile device possesses a DNN model
(e.g., AlexNet [23], ResNet [24], or VGG [25]) that can handle
a certain number of inference tasks (e.g., image recognition).
Meanwhile, the DNN model of each mobile device has an
identical backup stored on the edge node.
In DNNs, the size of the output data (i.e., feature data)
from some intermediate layers or blocks is typically smaller
than the size of the input data (i.e., raw data). As the number
of layers or blocks increases, the required computing capacity
(i.e., GFLOPs) gradually rises. As shown in Fig. 3, the input

data size of AlexNet and ResNet152 are both 0.574 MB. The
feature data size of AlexNet’s block 2 and ResNet152’s block
5 are 0.18 MB and 0.19 MB, representing 69% and 67% reduc-
tions compared to the input data size. Correspondingly, after
block 2, AlexNet requires GFLOPs that account for 90% of
the total GFLOPs, whereas ResNet152 needs 81% of its total
GFLOPs after block 5. Therefore, inference tasks generated by
resource-limited mobile devices can be ofﬂoaded to the MEC
server with a powerful computing capacity for processing.
More speciﬁcally, we can execute a part of the DNN inference
task locally on the mobile device, ofﬂoad a small amount of
intermediate feature data to the MEC server, and then execute
the remaining DNN inference task. The partitioning of DNN
models needs to consider the tradeoff between computation
and communication. From a more practical perspective, our
work addresses the policy of DNN model partitioning and
resource allocation when the inference time is not precisely
known in advance. For ease of reference, the main symbols
are summarized as Table I.

partitioning points.
while ResNet features two asymmetric branches [24]. Typi-
cally, the structure of DNNs is modeled as DAGs [14], [26].
However, this DAG-based modeling can be quite complex. For
simplicity, we use the block-based modeling approach [10],
[12]. This method involves dividing the DAG into multiple
blocks, effectively transforming it into a serial chain structure.
As shown in Fig. 4, each block we construct consists of multi-
ple layers, including convolutional layers (Conv), pooling lay-
ers (Pool), batch normalization layers (BN), activation layers
(such as ReLU), etc. Denote M as the number of blocks in the
DNN model. Then, the set of partitioning points is represented
as M ≜{0, 1, . . ., M}. Let xn,m ∈{0, 1}, n ∈N, m ∈M
be the partitioning decision, and there is only one partitioning
point for each mobile device, i.e., P
m∈M xn,m = 1, ∀n ∈N.
Speciﬁcally, xn,m = 1 indicates that mobile device n executes
partitioning at the mth point, and xn,m = 0 otherwise. For
instance, xn,0 = 1 means that mobile device n only executes
edge inference, xn,M = 1 means that mobile device n only
executes local inference, and xn,m = 1 means that the ﬁrst m
blocks execute local inference, and the remaining (M −m)
blocks execute edge inference.
B. Inference Time and Energy Consumption
As shown in Fig. 5, the inference time of each block of
AlexNet and ResNet152 on different hardware platforms is
tested. The inference time of each block exhibits signiﬁcant
uncertainty and randomness, making it challenging to predict
and understand the distribution of inference time precisely.
However, it is pleasing that on the higher-computing platform
(i.e., GeForce RTX 4080), the inference time and variation
for each block of AlexNet and ResNet152 are signiﬁcantly

reduced compared to the lower-computing platform (i.e., Jet-
son Xavier NX CPU/GPU). Therefore, dynamic voltage and
frequency scaling (DVFS) can be employed to optimize local
computing resource allocation on mobile devices, while task
ofﬂoading can be used to transfer computing to the MEC
server, thereby reducing both inference time and its variation.
We assume that the partitioning point is m ∈M, and then
the partitioning point set M is divided into two mutually
exclusive sets M0 ≜{0, 1, . . ., m} and M1 ≜M\M0 ≜
{m + 1, . . . , M}. Let uloc
n,k denote the local inference time of
the mobile device n in the kth block. Then, the local inference
time of mobile device n can be written as
tloc
n,m =
X
k∈M0
uloc
n,k, ∀n ∈N, m ∈M,
(1)
where tloc
n,0 = uloc
n,0 = 0. The dynamic power consumption of
the COMS circuit is denoted as αcV 2f, where α is the activity
factor, c is the load capacitance, V is the supply voltage,
and f is the CPU/GPU clock frequency [27]. Moreover, V
is approximately linear to the frequency when the CPU/GPU
operates in the non-low frequency range, i.e., V = kf [27],
[28]. Thus, the corresponding energy consumption of mobile
device n to execute local inference is

where κn = αncnk2
n is an energy efﬁciency coefﬁcient that
depends on the chip architecture.
Let bn denote the uplink bandwidth allocated by the edge
node to mobile device n for edge inference. The uplink
bandwidth allocated to each mobile device is constrained
by total bandwidth resource B, i.e., P
n∈N bn ≤B. The
spectral efﬁciency of wireless uplink between the edge node
and mobile device n is ηoﬀ
n
= log2 (1 + pnhn/bnN0), where
pn is the transmission power, hn is the channel gain, and N0 is
the noise power spectral density. The ofﬂoading time of mobile
device n to transmit data to the edge node can be given as

decision xn,m, dn,m can represent the size of the raw data,
feature data, or result data. For instance, dn,0 denotes the
size of the raw data, while dn,M represents the size of the
result data. The corresponding ofﬂoading energy consumption
of mobile device n is

The MEC server can generate a virtual machine (VM)
for each mobile device that executes edge inference. Each
VM is conﬁgured with the corresponding DNN model to its
associated mobile device and performs the ofﬂoading task in
parallel. For simplicity, we assume that the total computing
resources on the edge server are equally allocated to each VM,
and each VM is dedicated to serving its corresponding mobile
device [46], [47]. The delay introduced by VM conﬁguration
is usually small (e.g., ∼10 ms), so its impact on the overall
delay is negligible and has been disregarded.1 Let uvm
n,k denote
the edge inference time of mobile device n in the kth block.
The edge inference time of mobile device n can be expressed
as
tvm
n,m =
X
k∈M1
uvm
n,k, ∀n ∈N, m ∈M,
(5)
where tvm
n,M = 0. The time spent downloading the task com-
putation results from the edge node (e.g., 5G Base Station) to
the device is negligible, due to the strong transmission power
and high bandwidth of the edge node, as well as the relatively
small output data size (compared to the raw or feature data
size). For example, in object recognition applications, the
output typically consists of vehicles, pedestrians, etc., which
requires only a few bytes and is much smaller than the
corresponding input raw data or feature data, the latter of
which may be several megabytes. In addition, since the MEC
server is powered by the grid, the energy consumption of edge
inference and result downloading is not considered [29], [30].

can further reduce the latency of VM conﬁguration [48], [49].

uncertainty of inference time, which is given as follows
P {Tn ≤Dn} ≥1 −εn, ∀n ∈N,
(8)
where Dn is the deadline of the inference task, and εn is the
violation probability that mobile device n can tolerate, which
is a small positive constant also called risk level. In robust
optimization, constraint (8) is generally called the chance
constraint [34], [35].

(9d) represents constraints on uplink bandwidth allocation, and
(9f) and (9g) indicate uplink bandwidth and local computing
resources that can be allocated to mobile devices, respectively.
Although problem (9) is easy to understand, solving it in
practice is quite challenging. First and foremost, constraint
(9b) indicates the need to provide chance constraints for
the inference of each task with a hard deadline, which is
difﬁcult to handle. Second, similar to [12], [13] and [36],
the corresponding DNN partitioning and resource allocation
remains a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP)
problem even given the deterministic inference time, which
is generally NP-hard. To address above challenges, in the ab-
sence of precise inference time and its complete distributional
knowledge, we develop a robust DNN model partitioning
and resource allocation policy that relies solely on the mean
and variance information of the inference time. The speciﬁc
solutions are presented in Section IV and Section V.
Remark 1: It is worth noting that the problem (9) we propose
can be simpliﬁed to the case of the previous work by setting
the risk level of each mobile device to zero, and the mean and
variance of the inference time for each block to true and zero,
respectively. In this regard, the problem of uncertain inference
time explored in this paper is both more meaningful and more
challenging.

IV. MEAN AND VARIANCE OF INFERENCE TIME WITH
FREQUENCY SCALING
In this section, we ﬁrst provide a ﬁtting function of relation-
ship between mean inference time and CPU/GPU frequency
using nonlinear least squares method. Then, we present an
efﬁcient method to estimate the variance and covariance of
inference time across different CPU/GPU frequencies.
A. Mean Inference Time
The DVFS technology can be used to optimize inference
time and energy consumption. Therefore, it is essential to give
a model that accurately characterizes the relationship between
CPU/GPU frequency and inference time. Most existing work
models the inference time as a function of the workload and
the CPU/GPU frequency, typically expressed as their ratio.
The speciﬁc model is deﬁned as t =
w
gf , where w (in
GFLOPs) is the workload of the task, f (in GHz) is the
CPU/GPU frequency, and g (in FLOPs/cycle) is the workload
it can process per cycle [31], [32]. However, we ﬁnd that the
parameter g in the above model varies across different DNNs
and within different blocks of the same DNN. As illustrated in
Fig. 3 and Fig. 5, the total inference time of different DNNs
is not necessarily proportional to the total GFLOP under a
ﬁxed CPU/GPU frequency. Similarly, the inference time of
each block within the same DNN does not necessarily scale
proportionally with its respective GFLOP. For example, the
inference time of ResNet152 is 6-fold that of AlexNet, while
the required GFLOPs are 16-fold higher than those of AlexNet.
For AlexNet, the inference time of block 8 is higher than that
of other blocks, yet the required data size and GFLOPs are
quite small.
Therefore, we utilize real-world data to model the functional
relationship between inference time and CPU/GPU frequency.
The inference time of widely used DNNs (i.e., AlexNet
and ResNet152) is tested on multiple devices (e.g., Jeston
Xavier NX CPU and GPU) by frequency scaling. Speciﬁcally,
AlexNet and ResNet152 are partitioned into 2 and 3 blocks,
respectively. The sets of partitioning points are deﬁned as
m ∈M ≜{0, 1, 2} for AlexNet and m ∈M ≜{0, 1, 2, 3}
for ResNet152, where m = 0 indicates that the inference is
executed on the VM, resulting in the inference time of the

device being 0.2 We use nonlinear least square method to ﬁt
the measured data above. Fig. 6 illustrates the ﬁtting curve and
coefﬁcient of AlexNet and ResNet152 for different partitioning
points on CPU and GPU. For AlexNet, the squared 2-norm of
the residual at m = 1 and m = 2 is 2.0e-4 s2 and 9.7e-4
s2, respectively. For ResNet152, the squared 2-norm of the
residual at m = 1, m = 2, and m = 3 is 5.7e-4 s2, 8.0e-4 s2,
and 2.9e-3 s2, respectively.
According to the above results, the mean inference time
when mobile device n selects partitioning point m is modeled
as follows:
¯tloc
n,m = wn,m
gn,mfn
, ∀n ∈N, m ∈M,
(10)
where wn,m is the GFLOPs required for local inference, fn is
the local CPU/GPU frequency of mobile device n, and gn,m is
the FLOPs that can be processed per cycle, which is decided
by the partitioning point, the DNN model, and the CPU/GPU
hardware.
B. Variance and Covariance of Inference Time
Based on the measurement of mean inference time, the
variance of inference time for AlexNet and ResNet152 at
different CPU and GPU frequencies is calculated, as shown
in Fig. 7. It can be observed that the variance of AlexNet is
higher at low CPU frequencies, while the maximum variance
of ResNet152 occurs at around 0.7 GHz on the GPU. The
results indicate that the variance of inference time is not
a monotonic function of CPU/GPU frequency. In addition,
compared to inference on the CPU, the variance of inference
time on the GPU is relatively lower. However, the variance
of inference time exhibits random and irregular ﬂuctuations in
response to variations in CPU/GPU frequency. Therefore, it is
difﬁcult to ﬁt the relationship between variance and CPU/GPU
frequency as a function, in contrast to the modeling of the
mean inference time.
To solve the above problem, we use the mean value in
the CPU/GPU frequency scaling range as the variance of the

here. However, in the experiments where the blocks are partitioned into 8 or
9, each block demonstrated a similar curve, as depicted in Fig. 6.

and F is the set of
measurable frequency points of the CPU/GPU. This approxi-
mation may introduce some errors; however, simulation results
show the error is acceptable. The experiments and analysis are
discussed in Section VI. Note that in this work, we assume
the CPU/GPU frequencies of mobile devices can be scaled,
whereas the CPU/GPU frequencies of VMs remain constant.
Therefore, t
vm
n,m and vvm
n,m can be obtained through simple
online measurement.
During collaborative inference, covariance information be-
tween the mobile device and the VM is also required. Thus,
we designate Jetson Xavier and Nano as the mobile device and
RTX4080 as the VM, and calculate the covariance at different
partitioning points. The experimental results show that the
covariance curve closely matches the variance curve in Fig.
7. It is because the computing capacity of the VM is higher
than mobile devices, leading to lower inference time and
ﬂuctuations. Therefore, similar to variance, the covariance of
inference time at different partitioning points is approximated
by

where wn,m,m′(·) = E [tn,m(·)tn,m′(·)] −¯tn,m(·)¯tn,m′(·).
V. ROBUST DNN PARTITIONING AND RESOURCE
ALLOCATION
To tackle the challenges posed by the chance constraints and
combinatorial complexity of problem (9), we ﬁrst decompose
problem (9) into two subproblems: resource allocation and
DNN model partitioning. Subsequently, the two subproblems
with probabilistic constraints are equivalently transformed into
deterministic optimization problems using the CCP method.
Finally, convex optimization technique and PCCP technique
are applied to obtain the optimal solution of the resource
allocation subproblem and a stationary point of the DNN
model partitioning subproblem respectively.
A. Problem Decomposition
By leveraging the structure of the objective function and
constraints in problem (9), we ﬁnd that it can be decom-
posed into two subproblems with separated objectives and
constraints. We use the Tammer decomposition method [37]
to transform the high-complexity original problem into two
lower-complexity subproblems and solve these subproblems
alternately. First, the resource allocation subproblem is written
as
min
b,f E(b, f | x)
s.t.(9b), (9d), (9f), (9g).

where E(x | b, f) is the optimal value function corresponding
to the DNN model partitioning subproblem. Note that the
decomposition from the original problem (9) to problem
(13) and problem (14) does not change the optimality of
the solution [37]. In the following, we will give solutions
of the resource allocation subproblem and the DNN model
partitioning subproblem. The general schematic of the solution
is shown in Fig. 8.

Due to the lack of the distribution of inference time, a dif-
ﬁcult step is to reformulate the intractable chance constraints
in (16b) into the deterministic constraints. To address this, we
introduce a novel CCP technique [38], which does not intro-
duce any relaxation in the optimization space when the chance
constraint is transformed into a deterministic constraint. It
allows that the mean and covariance of random variables can
be measured without any assumptions. The details are given
as follows:

Proof. The proof of Theorem 1 is given in [38].

C. DNN Model Partitioning Subproblem
In the previous subsection, we obtained the optimal solution
to the bandwidth allocation b and computing resource alloca-
tion f under a given x. Next, we use the solutions b and f
obtained from resource allocation subproblem (16) to optimize
x. The DNN model partitioning subproblem of problem (14)
can be rewritten as

the intractable chance constraints in (24b), problem (24) is

the chance constraints into equivalent deterministic constraints.
The constraint (24b) can be formulated as

(28)
where wn,m,m is the diagonal element of the Wn matrix.
Then, we replace constraint (24b) in problem (24) with the

To handle the combinatorial nature of the binary variable x
of problem (29), we transform problem (29) into an equivalent
difference-of-convex (DC) problem and obtain a stationary
point of problem (29) using the PCCP technique. In what
follows, we ﬁrst replace the binary constraints in (24e) with
the following constraints:
xn,m ∈[0, 1], ∀n ∈N, m ∈M,
(30)
xn,m (1 −xn,m) ≤0, ∀n ∈N, m ∈M,

Then, we introduce auxiliary variables y ≜{yn}n∈N :
yn =

constraints (33d), (33e) and (33f), for which problem (33) is
identiﬁed as a DC problem that can be solved using the PCCP
technique [40].
We ﬁrst relax problem (33) by adding relaxation variables

avoid the infeasibility of each iteration. The penalty function

VI. SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section, we ﬁrst give the values of simulation
parameters, then show the convergence and complexity of the
proposed algorithms, and ﬁnally evaluate the performance of
the proposed algorithms under different parameter settings.
A. Simulation Setup
We simulate a 400 m × 400 m square area with the edge
node located at the center of the area. The mobile devices are


--- Page 11 ---
11
distributed uniformly and randomly across the coverage area
of the edge node. The uplink wireless channel gain between
mobile device n and the edge node is modeled as hn = 38 +
30 × log10 rn [41], where hn and rn are the path-loss (in dB)
and distance between device n and the edge node (in meters),
respectively. Additionally, the total uplink wireless bandwidth
is set to B = 10 MHz and B = 30 MHz for different DNN
models, the transmit power pn of mobile device n is set to 1
W, and the noise power density is N0 = −174 dBm/Hz [12],
[15].

Three widely-used DNNs, AlexNet [23], ResNet152 [24]
and ViT-B/32 [50], are considered. The three DNNs are
fully deployed on mobile devices and the MEC server. The
task of the mobile device is image recognition, which is
extracted from the object recognition dataset CIFAR-10 [42].
The processing unit of mobile devices adopts Jetson Xavier
NX CPU and GPU [43], as well as Jetson Nano GPU [51].
We assume that AlexNet is deployed on the Jetson Xavier NX
CPU, ResNet152 is deployed on Jetson Xavier NX GPU, and
ViT-B/32 is deployed on Jetson Nano GPU. The VM assigned
to the mobile device uses the GeForce RTX 4080. Speciﬁc
conﬁgurations are shown in Table II.
The energy efﬁciency coefﬁcient κn of Jetson Xavier NX
CPU and GPU is evaluated using the power testing tool
Tegrastats of NVIDIA [44]. Speciﬁcally, Jetson Xavier NX is
ﬁrst set to a ﬁxed power consumption mode. Then, the power
consumption of the CPU and GPU at different frequencies is
measured, and ﬁnally, κn is obtained based on the measured
data. By estimation, the average κn of the Jetson Xavier
NX CPU, Jetson Xavier NX GPU and Jetson Nano GPU are
0.8×10−27W/(cycle/sec)3, 2.8×10−27W/(cycle/sec)3, and
3.2 × 10−27W/(cycle/sec)3, respectively.
AlexNet, ResNet152 and ViT-B/32 are divided into 8, 9 and
6 blocks, corresponding to 9, 10 and 7 partitioning points,
respectively. The feature data size of each block can be
calculated based on its output data shape. The mean inference
time for each block is obtained through 500 experiments, and
then the variance and covariance can also be calculated based
on the mean and measured data. The speciﬁc parameters are
shown in Table III, IV and V. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, the
above parameters are used by default.
To evaluate the performance of Algorithm 1, we consider
the following two policies as benchmark:
1) Random policy: the DNN partitioning point is randomly
selected from the set of points where the feature data is
smaller than the raw data.
2) Optimal policy: the DNN partitioning point is obtained
using the exhaustive search method, which can ﬁnd the

optimal partitioning point, but its computational complex-
ity is exponential.
To evaluate the performance of Algorithm 2, we consider
the following two methods as benchmark:
1) Worst-case optimization: the upper bound of tloc
n,m and
tvm
n,m obtained by the experiment is taken as the inference
time, and the task deadline is not allowed to be violated.
2) Mean-value optimization: the inference time only adopts
the mean value, without considering the uncertainty in
inference time. This is a primitive method that bypasses
the uncertainty, without any probabilistic guarantees.
B. Convergence and Complexity
First, we show the convergence of the proposed algorithms.
Fig. 9 illustrates the average number of iterations of Algorithm
1 versus the number of mobile devices. Although the number
of iterations of Algorithm 1 cannot be analytically charac-
terized, we can see from Fig. 9 that even when the number
of devices N = 30, Algorithm 1 can terminate after a few
iterations. Moreover, the average number of iterations for ViT-
B/32, AlexNet, and ResNet152 are not signiﬁcantly different.
In addition, the average number of iterations of Algorithm 1
increases slightly as the number of mobile devices increases
signiﬁcantly. This indicates that Algorithm 1 based on PCCP
has better scalability.
Fig. 10(a) and Fig. 10(b) illustrate the convergence trajec-
tories of Algorithm 2 from different initial points in AlexNet,
ResNet152, and ViT-B/32 models, respectively. We select three
different points as the initial points from all the partitioning
points of AlexNet, ResNet152, and ViT-B/32, respectively. For
example, the initial points for AlexNet are 3, 7, and 9; for
ResNet152, they are 1, 8, and 9; and for ViT-B/32, they are 3,
4, and 5. From Fig. 10, it can be observed that the advantage of
using Algorithm 2 is its ability to converge quickly in the early
stages of iteration. In addition, Algorithm 2 almost converges
to the same objective function value for different initial points.
Then, we show the computational complexity of the pro-
posed algorithms. Fig. 11 illustrates the runtime of Algorithm
2 on AlexNet, ResNet152, and ViT-B/32. The simulation
experiments are implemented using MATLAB and conducted
on a laptop computer with an Intel Core i7-8700 3.2 GHz
CPU and 16 GB RAM. In Fig. 11, the runtime for AlexNet

with N = 6 is normalized to 1. From Fig. 11, it can be seen
that the runtime of the proposed algorithm increases linearly
with the number of mobile devices, despite the exponentially
growing search space. Since the ResNet152 model has 10
partitioning points, its average runtime is slightly higher than
that of the AlexNet model, which has 9 partitioning points.
Despite having only 7 partitioning points, the ViT-B/32 model
actually exhibits a higher runtime. It is because, as shown in
Fig. 10, the ViT-B/32 model requires more iterations than both
AlexNet and ResNet152. Combining this with the computa-
tional complexity analysis in Section IV, we observed that the
complexity of the proposed Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 are
polynomial time with respect to the number of partitioning
points and mobile devices.
In addition, we found that although the theoretical compu-
tational complexity of the IPT method is proportional to M
and N to the 3.5th power, i.e., O

when the number of devices increases from N
= 6 to
N = 36, the runtimes of AlexNet, ResNet152, and ViT-B/32
increase by less than 5 times. This observed runtime growth
is much lower than what would be expected based solely on
the theoretical computational complexity. It may be related
to factors such as the optimization methods employed by the
solver and the performance of the hardware platform. For
larger-scale networks, such as M ≫10, and N ≫36, we can
consider combining the proposed algorithm with distributed
optimization to reduce the computational complexity of the
algorithm.
C. Performance Evaluation
In this subsection, we investigate the impact of variance
approximation, different device numbers, risk levels, and task
deadlines on the total energy consumption under the AlexNet,
ViT-B/32, and ResNet152 models. In addition, we further
analyze the violation probability of the task deadline under
varying risk levels.
1) Impact of variance approximation: The approximation
performance of (11) and (12) in Section IV. B is evaluated
below. Fig. 12 shows the energy consumption and violation
probability of AlexNet, ResNet152, and ViT-B/32 using the

an approximation of (11) and (12). The maximum variance
method is approximated as follows:

where ∀n ∈N, ∀m, m′ ∈M.
In Figs. 12 (a), (c), and (e), we ﬁrst show the violation
probability as εn increases. It can be observed that the
maximum variance method has a lower violation probability
than the mean variance method, as the maximum variance
method is more conservative. For AlexNet and ResNet152,
even when εn increases to 0.15, the violation probability of
the mean variance method remains lower than the risk level.
However, for ViT-B/32, when εn exceeds 0.13, the violation
probability of the mean variance method is slightly higher
than the risk level. Then, in Figs. 12 (b), (d), and (f), we
illustrate the changes in energy consumption as εn increases.
It can be observed that the mean variance method results
in lower energy consumption compared to the maximum
variance method. For AlexNet, ResNet, and ViT-B/32, the
mean variance method can reduce energy consumption by
up to 17%, 6.8%, and 4%, respectively, compared to the
maximum variance method when εn = 0.03.

2) Performance of Algorithm 1: Fig. 13 evaluates the
performance of Algorithm 1 under different DNN models.
Firstly, we can observe that the total energy consumption
increases with the number of mobile devices. Compared to
the random policy, the total energy consumption of Algorithm
1 is much lower. Moreover, as the number of devices increases,
the energy consumption of Algorithm 1 increases at a slower
rate than the random policy. Secondly, the performance of the
proposed Algorithm 1 is very close to the optimal policy. The
computational complexity of the optimal policy is O
 M N
,
which is exponential, while the proposed PCCP-based Al-
gorithm 1 can ﬁnd a stationary point of the DNN model
partitioning subproblem, and its computational complexity is
polynomial.
3) Impact of risk levels: Fig. 14(a), Fig. 15(a), and Fig.
16(a) show the total energy consumption at different risk
levels. Currently, there is no effective solution that guaran-
tees the deadline for DNN partitioning under inference time
uncertainty. For comparison, we compare the worst-case and
mean optimization methods with our proposed Algorithm 2.
As shown in Fig. 14(a), the total energy consumption of
Algorithm 2 is always lower than that of the worst-case
optimization. Even when the risk level ε = 0.03, total energy
consumption can be reduced by nearly 44.8%. When the risk
level increases to 0.09, the total energy consumption of Algo-
rithm 2 saves 53.1% compared to the worst-case optimization.
As the risk level increases from 0.03 to 0.09, we observe
that the total energy consumption monotonically decreases,
which is as expected with (22) and (28) that we derived.
From (22), it can be observed that under a given partitioning
decision, σn decreases as εn increases, which means that
the variance term of the uncertainty in inference time (i.e.,
the second term on the left side of (22)) becomes smaller.
Mobile devices can save energy consumption by reducing
CPU/GPU frequency. Similarly, it can be seen from (28) that
under given communication and computing resources, mobile

devices can save energy consumption by selecting appropriate
DNN partitioning points.
Fig. 15(a) and Fig. 16(a) show that the energy consumption
of ResNet152 and ViT-B/32 also gradually decreases as εn
increases. At εn = 0.06, compared to the worst-case optimiza-
tion, ResNet152 and ViT-B/32 can save energy consumption
by nearly 9.3% and 5.8%, respectively. As shown in Figs.
14(c), 15(c), and 16(c), similar to the worst-case optimization,
the violation probability of AlexNet and ResNet152 remains
close to 0 even when εn = 0.06, while the violation probability
of ViT-B/32 is only 3.5%. Moreover, we observe that AlexNet
on CPU exhibits a higher proportion of energy saving than
ResNet152 and ViT-B/32 on GPU. This is because (1) GPUs
are more energy-efﬁcient during DNN inference than CPUs,
leading to lower relative energy savings when switching to
our method, and (2) as discussed in Section IV, the variance
in inference time for ResNet152 and ViT-B/32 is relatively
small, which limits the potential for our method to further
reduce energy consumption. These results demonstrate that our
proposed algorithms are particularly effective for DNNs with


--- Page 15 ---
15
considerable variations in inference time.
Additionally, it can be seen from Figs. 14(a), 15(a), and
16(a) that the energy consumption of mean-value optimization
is lower than that of Algorithm 2, but mean-value optimization
lacks probabilistic guarantees. It will be discussed in detail in
the following.
4) Impact of task deadlines: Figs. 14(b), 15(b), and 16(b)
show total energy consumption at various task deadlines for
a given risk level. It can be observed that for AlexNet,
ResNet152, and ViT-B/32, the total energy consumption de-
creases monotonically as task deadlines increase. This is
because, as the task deadline increases, mobile devices have
more opportunities to select blocks with high computing power
requirements and large inference time ﬂuctuations for DNN
partitioning and ofﬂoading these blocks to the MEC server
for execution, thereby reducing local inference energy con-
sumption. Additionally, the energy consumption of Algorithm
2 is lower than that of the worst-case policy at various task
deadlines. For AlexNet, the energy consumption of Algorithm
2 decreases by 54.6% when the deadline Dn varies from 160
ms to 280 ms. For ResNet152, the energy consumption of
Algorithm 2 decreases by 37.6% when the deadline Dn varies
from 105 ms to 165 ms. For ViT-B/32, the energy consumption
of Algorithm 2 decreases by 17.8% when the deadline Dn
varies from 90 ms to 150 ms.
5) Deadline violation probability: Leveraging real-world
data from Nvidia hardware platforms, we analyze the deadline
violation probability of Algorithm 2 under various risk level
settings. As illustrated in Fig. 14(c), 15(c) and 16(c), we
present the deadline violation probabilities at different risk
levels achieved by Algorithm 2 and the other 2 benchmarks.
As expected, the violation probabilities of the worst-case
optimization for inference on AlexNet, ResNet152, and ViT-
B/32 are all 0. It is because worst-case optimization is the
most conservative method, but it also has the highest energy
consumption, as shown in Figs. 14(b), 15(b), and 16(b).
As for the mean-value optimization, it leads to more than
40.5%, 49.5%, and 32.7% violation probabilities for AlexNet,
ResNet152, and ViT-B/32, respectively. This is due to the fact
that the mean-value optimization approach fails to account
for uncertainty in inference time. Although it achieves lower
energy consumption compared to Algorithm 2, it is a primitive
method that bypasses the uncertainty, without any probabilistic
guarantees.
Then, we observe that the violation probability of Algorithm
2 is always lower than the risk level, which afﬁrms the desired
probabilistic guarantees and demonstrates the robustness of
Algorithm 2 in handling uncertain DNN inference time. The
gap between the risk level and the violation probability can be
attributed to the fact that the actual inference time of DNNs
does not invariably result in the maximum violation probabil-
ity. This observation is consistent with our design in Section
IV-A, where we approximate the variance of DNN inference
time using the mean value in the CPU/GPU frequency scaling
range. Although this approximation introduces some errors,
it further reduces energy consumption compared with the
maximum variance approximation while showing high robust-
ness. It can be seen that as the risk level gradually increases,

although the violation probability rises, it is still far below
the risk level. As shown in Figs. 14(a) and 15(a), Algorithm
2 compared with worst-case optimization can achieve nearly
50.4% and 9.4% energy savings for AlexNet and ResNet152,
respectively, when the actual violation probability is less than
0.5% (i.e., εn = 0.06). Furthermore, Fig. 16(a) shows that
Algorithm 2 achieves about 6.4% energy savings at an actual
violation probability of 0.5% (i.e., εn = 0.03).
6) Performance under dynamic workload: Fig. 17(a) and
Fig. 17(b) show the changes in latency and variance of local
inference executed by AlexNet before and after the application
of a workload. In Fig. 17(a), only AlexNet inference is
executed on Jetson Xavier NX CPU, with no other workload.
In Fig. 17(b), while the AlexNet inference task is being
executed, a trajectory planning task is also added to the CPU
for parallel processing. It can be found that the mean inference
time and the variation in inference time of AlexNet increase
signiﬁcantly when a workload is added.
Fig. 18 shows the performance of the proposed policy
under the dynamic workload. It can be observed that as εn
increases, energy consumption gradually decreases. Moreover,
even when the inference time ﬂuctuates signiﬁcantly, the actual
deadline violation probability is lower than the risk level.
This is because, through reasonable model partitioning, the
system ofﬂoads DNN blocks that are heavily affected by the
workload to the MEC server, thereby reducing the impact of
high workload on the inference task.

VII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we investigated the problem of edge-device
collaborative inference under uncertain inference time. Our ex-
periments demonstrate that executing DNN inference tasks on
high-performance GPUs can signiﬁcantly enhance inference
speed and reduce variations in inference time. This motivates
us to develop an effective scheme for DNN model partitioning
and resource allocation to achieve a balance among commu-
nication costs, computational requirements, and variations in
inference time within edge intelligence systems. Therefore, we
formulate the problem as an optimization problem that mini-
mizes the total energy consumption of mobile devices while
meeting task probabilistic deadlines. To solve this problem,
we employ chance-constrained programming (CCP), which
permits occasional violations of the target capacity threshold
with a low probability, thereby reformulating the probabilistic
constraint problem as a deterministic optimization problem.
Then, the optimal solution of local CPU/GPU frequencies and
uplink bandwidth allocation and a stationary point of DNN
partitioning decisions are obtained using convex optimization
and penalty convex-concave procedure (PCCP) techniques,
respectively. We evaluate our proposed algorithm with real-
world data and widely used DNN models. Extensive simula-
tions demonstrate that, compared to worst-case optimization,
our proposed algorithm achieves approximately 50.4%, 9.4%,
and 6.4% energy savings for AlexNet, ResNet152, and ViT-
B/32, respectively, while maintaining an actual violation prob-
ability of not exceeding 0.5%.
Finally, we conclude the paper with several promising
directions for future research. First, edge intelligence systems
involve high-speed mobile scenarios, such as connected vehi-
cles and drones. These mobile devices introduce uncertainties
due to their dynamic nature. Consequently, our method can
be extended to high-speed mobile scenarios and subject to
joint design and optimization. Second, in multi-user edge in-
telligence systems, edge servers may experience computational
resource competition when generating virtual machines (VMs)
for each device, thereby introducing additional uncertainty-
induced delays. Therefore, joint optimization and allocation
of device-edge resources can further enhance system perfor-
mance. Third, the proposed algorithm can be further extended
to cross-continuous inference tasks, such as video streaming.
To achieve this, time-related information needs to be incorpo-
rated into the system model, and the impact of autocorrelation
on inference time uncertainty and the probabilistic constraints
in the CCP model should be analyzed.
