ABSTRACT
The inaugural ACM International Conference on AI-powered Soft-
ware introduced the AIware Challenge, prompting researchers to ex-
plore AI-driven tools for optimizing conference programs through
constrained optimization. We investigate the use of Large Language
Models (LLMs) for program scheduling, focusing on zero-shot learn-
ing and integer programming to measure paper similarity. Our study
reveals that LLMs, even under zero-shot settings, create reasonably
good first drafts of conference schedules. When clustering papers,
using only titles as LLM inputs produces results closer to human
categorization than using titles and abstracts with TFIDF. The code
has been made publicly available1.

INTRODUCTION
The inaugural ACM International Conference on AI-powered Soft-
ware debuts the AIware Challenge, encouraging researchers and
practitioners to implement AI-driven tools to create an optimized
conference program, a fundamental issue in constraint optimiza-
tion. Constrained optimization is a prevalent mathematical task,
needing intensive computational resources and tailored algorithms
to address the unique complexities of the decision space. Applying

Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated significant suc-
cess in various domains such as mathematical problem-solving and
reasoning.
This report investigates the feasibility of leveraging LLMs to ad-
dress the program scheduling challenge. Our investigation revolves
around two primary approaches: 1) zero-shot learning to generate
the schedules and 2) integer programming with LLMs to measure
the similarity between papers.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Our paper focuses on automating the allocation of papers to pre-
determined sessions, treating it as an allocation and constrained
clustering problem. We do not factor in the specific timing of paper
presentations or the impact of parallel tracks, earmarking these
as potential areas for future investigation on the broader goal of
automating conference scheduling.

EXPERIMENTS
3.1
Zero-Shot Scheduling by LLMs
Our first AIware approach directly prompts a large language model
to make the schedule. While LLMs have a lot of room to improve on
arithmetic reasoning tasks, recent approaches have been proposed
to improve their abilities for math problems[1, 4, 5]. Furthermore,
LLMs are expected to improve at solving LLMs at zero-shot config-
urations, too, due to the scaling laws[3].
However, from our experiments, we find the LLMs are still unable
to create schedules without violating constraints. We, therefore,
additionally experiment with smaller-scale problems by downsam-
pling the number of sessions or papers within each session. To
measure the performance of our approach, we measure the follow-
ing metrics:
• Completeness and Homogeneity wrt the ground truth[2]
• % of constraints broken, for various types of constraints.
We use a temperature setting of 0.8 in our experiments.
We find that GPT-4 in zero-shot settings can generate reason-
ably good conference schedules. We also counted the number of
violations according to the schedule created by the GPT -4. Looking
at violations on the number of sessions and papers in the proposed
schedule, we find that, on average, less than 3 papers were missing,
and two sessions were added. Furthermore, checking if the session
durations are within bounds, we find that while many sessions
proposed were too long (in some cases, more than 50%), in most
cases, the proposed session was off by less than 10% of the length of
the session. This suggests that by moving around a couple of papers
between sessions, a human can finish the work mostly done by an
LLM, suggesting a collaboration with LLMs be the best approach.

Figure 1: Comparing the homogeneity and completeness
score for different number of papers per session. Homogene-
ity deteriorates when the scale of the data is larger, but not
completeness.
Computing the homogeneity and completeness scores with re-
spect to the actual schedule of MSR 2022 (Figure 1), we find that
while homogeneity drops with an increase in problem size, com-
pleteness is not as much affected.
3.2
Integer Program using LLM to measure
similarity
In Section 3.1, we discover that LLMs face challenges in strict ad-
herence to all constraints, particularly when dealing with many
papers. We plan to explore how to leverage the text-understanding
capabilities of LLMs to facilitate the problem.
We incorporate the similarity of papers as an objective in our
optimization process to build an integer programming problem and
use LLM to generate the similarity. Recognizing that similarity is a
subjective concept, we have utilized the existing session arrange-
ment as the benchmark for comparison. To assess the proximity of
our results to the original schedule, we employ the completeness
score and homogeneity score metrics [2].
Leveraging LLMs’ text-understanding capabilities, we cluster
the papers into 5 groups and contrast the outcomes with a Bag of
Words approach featuring TFIDF normalization. The comparison,
outlined in Table 1, demonstrates the superior performance of LLM
when utilizing only the paper titles compared to TFIDF with both
titles and abstracts.
To further evaluate the clustering outcomes, we formulate an in-
teger programming problem (formula see Appendix) using the best
results from LLM with text alone and TFIDF with text and abstract
as the similarity parameters. The similarity metric indicates that
papers 𝑖and 𝑗sharing the same cluster exhibit a similarity value of
1, and 0 otherwise. completeness score and homogeneity score are
outlined in Table 2. Notably, the comprehensive and homogeneity
scores align LLM’s clustering result closely with TFIDF. This align-
ment reflects a common scenario in optimization problems where
the parameters are derived from predicted outcomes.

Our experimentation shows that LLMs are a promising tool in
managing optimization problems even when they lack precision

To address this limitation, a potential strategy involves involving
humans in the loop, or combining the strengths of LLMs and numer-
ical solvers as we demonstrated through our clustering + Integer

LLMs were used to reword sections and to reformat tables in the
paper. However, we did not generate entire sections through LLMs.

A
PROMPT DESIGN
The following is the template of the prompt we used. Note that the
terms surrounded by curly braces ({}) show where the list of papers
was added.
Program creation is the process of taking all the
accepted papers to a conference and allocating a
presentation slot for each paper with parallel sessions.
The PC chairs of a conference typically do this manually.
Assign sessions to the following papers based on
the following constraints:
1. The total length of all paper presentations
within a session should be less than or equal to
the length of the session they are in.
2. No new sessions should be added.
3. The "Discussions and Q/A" event should only be
at the end of a session if present.
4. All papers must be assigned to some session.
The output should contain the schedule in the form
of the csv representation of a data frame. This
csv representation should be in three quotes (```)
on both sides so that I can easily extract it
from your result and make a data frame.
Example output format(use as many rows as the
actual number of papers):
```
session@talk_title@duration
231@An Empirical Study on Maintainable Method ...@7
223@Improve Quality of Cloud Serverless ...@7
15@Extracting corrective actions from code ...@7
15@How to Improve Deep Learning for Software ...@7
11@ReCover: a Curated Dataset for Regression...@4
```
The list of paper and session titles are below:
Session Lengths:
{sessions_df_string}
Paper durations:
{papers_df_string}
Make sure, above all else, that your response
is formatted as requested, with the proper headers.
Some points to note:
• On top of giving the list of papers, we gave a list of sessions
with session length.
• We shuffled the list of papers so the LLM would not copy the
original ordering.
• We opted for values separated by the commercial at sym-
bol (@) rather than commas to make handling titles with
commas easier.
• The final statement was added to increase the chances of
getting the output in the right format.
