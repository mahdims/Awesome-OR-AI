Optimization modeling plays a critical role in the application of Operations Research (OR) tools to address
real-world problems, yet they pose challenges and require extensive expertise from OR experts. With the
advent of large language models (LLMs), new opportunities have emerged to streamline and automate such
task. However, current research predominantly relies on closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4, along with
extensive prompt engineering techniques. This reliance stems from the scarcity of high-quality training
datasets for optimization modeling, resulting in elevated costs, prolonged processing times, and privacy
concerns. To address these challenges, our work is the first to propose a viable path for training open-source
LLMs that are capable of optimization modeling and developing solver codes, eventually leading to a superior
ability for automating optimization modeling and solving. Particularly, we design the OR-Instruct, a
semi-automated data synthesis framework for optimization modeling that enables customizable enhancements
for specific scenarios or model types. This work also introduces IndustryOR, the first industrial benchmark
for evaluating LLMs in solving practical OR problems. We train several 7B-scale open-source LLMs using
synthesized data (dubbed ORLMs), which exhibit significantly enhanced optimization modeling capabilities,
achieving competitive performance across the NL4OPT, MAMO, and IndustryOR benchmarks. Additionally,
our experiments highlight the potential of scaling law and reinforcement learning to further enhance the
performance of ORLMs. The workflows and human-machine interaction paradigms of ORLMs in practical
industrial applications are also discussed in the paper.

development of computing capability (including both the development of algorithm and hardware)
and the growing amount of data, optimization models are playing more and more significant roles in
the operations of large corporations. For instance, optimization techniques used by JD.com enable
them to handle 10 times the normal volume of orders during peak sales seasons, helping the company
decrease its fulfillment expense ratio to a world-leading level of 6.5%, which has resulted in hundreds
of millions of dollars in savings (Qin et al. 2022). Baosteel, one of the largest steel company in China,
utilized integer optimization for production planning at its main plant in Shanghai, leading to a
significant reduction in carbon monoxide emissions — over 500,000 tons annually — as reported
by INFORMS (2013). The U.S. Census Bureau was recognized as a finalist for the 2022 Franz
Edelman Award for their innovative use of operations research and analytics in reengineering field
operations for the 2020 U.S. Census. This project utilizes advanced analytics, optimization, and
machine learning techniques to automate and optimize the scheduling, workload assignments, and
management of field data collection, a process previously done manually (Adams et al. 2023). Despite
the huge amount of success stories, the sensitivity of optimization models to environmental changes
necessitates frequent adjustments in dynamically evolving business contexts. This, combined with the
high level of expertise and substantial labor costs required for optimization modeling, represents a
significant bottleneck that has hindered the full potential to be unlocked for optimization techniques.
The advent of large language models (LLMs) gives an emerging hope to the above challenge. As
soon as its advent, these pre-trained LLMs have exhibited remarkable capabilities in rapid knowledge
comprehension and cross-disciplinary learning, demonstrating remarkable success and transformative
potential across various fields (Huang et al. 2024a), like medical consultation (Wang et al. 2023b),
software development (Zaremba et al. 2021), offering stock market trading strategies (Chen et al.
2022b), improving recommendation systems (Xu et al. 2024), and enhancing marketing research
(Wang et al. 2024). In the realm of more abstract mathematical reasoning, research has increasingly
incorporated more techniques to enhance the capabilities of large models, yielding promising results.
For example, Trinh et al. (2024) train Alphaproof with hundreds of billions of synthetic data used
to tackle complex olympiad geometry problems. Similarly, MathScale (Tang et al. 2024) offers a
straightforward and scalable method to generate high-quality data for mathematical reasoning,
establishing a foundation for further training of large language models in mathematical reasoning
capabilities.
In recent years, with the advancements in pre-trained language models (PLMs) such as GPT-4
and Claude-3.5, a growing number of studies have explored automating the modeling and solving
of optimization problems expressed in natural language. To produce complete solutions, including
executable programs that leverage established solvers, existing approaches often employ prompt
engineering techniques and multi-agent collaboration frameworks built on proprietary LLMs, such as

Chain-of-Experts (Xiao et al. 2023), OptiMUS (AhmadiTeshnizi et al. 2024), and OptiGuide (Li
et al. 2023a). However, utilizing online APIs for advanced large models offers no assurances of
privacy protection, which is prohibitive in some sensitive industry applications. Additionally, these
approaches are heavily reliant on the inherent capabilities of the foundational LLMs themselves,
rendering them incapable of addressing the customized needs of users. As illustrated in Figure 1, even
a basic optimization modeling problem presents challenges for the cutting-edge foundational large
language model, GPT-4. It demonstrates deficiencies in comprehending and transforming logical
constraints, which imposes a limitation on methods dependent on these general closed-source LLMs.
Toy manufacturers can produce and sell toy trucks, airplanes, boats, and trains. The profit from selling 
one truck is $5, one airplane is $10, one boat is $8, and one train is $7. During the production process, 
890 units of wood are available. Manufacturing one truck requires 12 units of wood, one airplane requires 
20 units of wood, one boat requires 15 units of wood, and one train requires 10 units of wood. There are 
500 units of steel available. Manufacturing one airplane requires 3 units of steel, one boat requires 5 units 
of steel, one train requires 4 units of steel, and one truck requires 6 units of steel.
In actual production operations, the following production conditions must be observed:
1. If trucks are manufactured, trains will not be manufactured.
2. If boats are manufactured, airplanes will also be manufactured.
3. The number of toy boats manufactured cannot exceed the number of toy trains manufactured.
How many types of toys should the manufacturer produce to maximize profit?

To solve this problem, we can formulate it as a linear programming problem. We will define the decision

An example is presented to illustrate the failure of advanced large models to accurately respond to
seemingly straightforward optimization modeling questions. The responses highlighted in reds contain
errors, specifically the introduction of non-linear terms and misunderstandings of logical relationships.
This response was generated in June 2024, originating from the web-based GPT-4.
In summary, existing large language models (LLMs) for optimization modeling exhibit the following
deficiencies:


--- Page 4 ---
Huang et al.: ORLM: A Customizable Framework in Training Large Models for Automated Optimization Modeling

1. Limited modeling capabilities. Contemporary advanced LLMs frequently exhibit errors
in interpreting logical constraints or inadvertently incorporate nonlinear elements, making it
difficult to model real-world problems effectively.
2. Insufficient quality of optimization modeling training data. The quality and scale of
data are directly proportional to the capability of the model, as described by the Scaling Law
(Kaplan et al. 2020). However, a shortage in high-quality optimization modeling training data
is often a critical challenge, obstructing the advancement of LLMs’ modeling ability.
3. Data privacy concerns. Dependence on APIs for closed-source LLMs may lead to data
breaches which hampers the broader adoption and development of LLM technologies in the
industrial sector.
4. Test sets are relatively homogeneous. The efficacy of large language models in automatic
modeling is predominantly assessed using the dataset provided by the NL4OPT competition
(Ramamonjison et al. 2023). This dataset primarily focuses on simple linear programming tasks
that exhibit relatively low complexity, narrow scope, and few types compared to real-world
applications.
To fill this gap, this paper introduces, for the first time, a new path for training an open-source large
language model specifically designed for modeling and solving optimization problems. To address the
core of the above challenges, we present a semi-automated framework for the synthesis of high-quality
optimization modeling data, aimed at progressively enhancing the specialized modeling capabilities
of LLMs. We hope that this approach will inspire future research and serve as a foundation for
the deeper integration of large models with operations research. Our main contributions can be
summarized as follows:
1. To ensure the effectiveness, robustness, and real-world applicability of our model, we have
identified four crucial requirements that the training dataset must fulfill, as informed by academic
research like Alzubaidi et al. (2023), Jiang et al. (2024) and industry insights. Inspired by these
requirements, we design and implement OR-Instruct, a semi-automated process for creating
synthetic data tailored to optimization modeling. The process uses an iterative bootstrapping
algorithm (see Figure 2). Initially, we collect a set of seed industry cases (e.g., 686 cases in our
study) and add them to the training data pool. Following this, we use two strategies. One is
expansion, which employs GPT-4 and leverages its in-context learning capability to generate
data spanning diverse scenarios and question types. Another is the augmentation strategy,
which involves modifying objectives and constraints, rephrasing questions, and incorporating
diverse modeling techniques to ensure the difficulty and quality of generation problems. Finally,
heuristics are used to automatically filter out obviously low-quality data. This cycle can be
repeated multiple iterations until the training data pool reaches the requisite volume (e.g.,

32,481 cases in our study). Notably, this approach is highly customizable; new seed data and
scenarios can be seamlessly introduced to adapt the dataset to specific needs.

Overview of OR-Instruct.
2. To evaluate the efficacy of OR-Instruct, we introduce IndustryOR, the inaugural industrial
benchmark tailored for optimization modeling. This benchmark uses data sourced from 13
different industries, covering 5 types of questions across 3 levels of difficulty. For comprehensive
evaluation, we also include NL4OPT (Ramamonjison et al. 2023) and MAMO (Huang et al.
2024b) benchmarks.
3. We utilize the synthetic data generated by OR-Instruct to train a series of open-source large
language models, each approximately 7 billion parameters in size, including Mistral-7B (Jiang
et al. 2023), Deepseek-Math-7B-Base (Shao et al. 2024), and LLaMA-3-8B (AI@Meta 2024).
We designate these trained models as Operation Research Language Models (ORLMs) and
observe a marked enhancement in their optimization modeling capabilities. Our experimental
results show that the best-performing ORLM achieves competitive performance on the NL4OPT,
MAMO, and IndustryOR benchmarks. Building upon this foundation, we conduct extensive
numerical experiments to analyze the limitations of the ORLM and propose feasible solutions
for its improvement. The results highlight the promising prospects of ORLM in advancing the
application and development of operations research, while also suggesting potential human-
LLM collaboration frameworks. These frameworks demonstrate how ORLM could enhance the
productivity of both industry and academia in the field of operations research.

To our best knowledge, this work is the first initiative to train open-source LLMs specifically for
optimization modeling in real-world industries. The proposed approach significantly reduces the
reliance on closed-source LLMs thus adding significant flexibility to the training process and greatly
enhancing privacy preservation for industrial applications. Remarkably, the highest-performing
ORLM achieves competitive results on the NL4OPT, MAMO, and IndustryOR benchmarks. This
suggests that in the field of optimization modeling, our approach enables ORLMs with approximately
7 billion parameters to outperform many cutting-edge large language models, such as GPT-4,
Llama-3.1, Qwen 2.5, and related agent-based frameworks.
We also conduct a thorough analysis of the ORLM’s results, with numerous ablation experiments
validating the effectiveness of our approach. The results show that, although ORLM performs
relatively weak on some challenging datasets, several strategies can still ensure improvements in its
performance. For instance, applying scaling laws to further increase the model size and data scale
leads to continuous performance enhancements. Additionally, we find that ORLM has weak ranking
capabilities for optimal optimization models. Using alignment strategies, such as reinforcement
learning, also helps strengthen ORLM’s performance.
Furthermore, we want to comment that the proposed data synthesis method, the OR-Instruct, has
the ability to facilitate customization to address particular needs of larger models, such as supply
chain management, scheduling, inventory issues, or enhancing capabilities in linear programming,
integer programming, and mixed integer programming. This synthetic data framework robustly
addresses the scarcity of training data for optimization modeling, provides a valuable reference for
advancing the application of operations research in various industrial sectors with the support of
large models. In Section 6.1, we provide a detailed discussion of representative workflows driven by
large models.
Finally, we note that almost all of our results, including certain samples from the training data
set, industry-level benchmark for optimization modeling, and all the best-performing LLMs that
have been fine-tuned, are made open source. We hope that our work can serve as a foundation for
subsequent explorations, empowering future researchers to enhance the utility and efficiency of large
language models in optimization modeling.
The structure of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the literature related to our
research. Section 3 delineates four essential conditions required for the training data and outlines the
implementation specifics of the semi-automated synthetic data framework for optimized modeling,
OR-Instruct. Section 4 examines the impact of training open-source large models on various test
sets and presents the experimental outcomes of customized enhancements in modeling capabilities.

areas for improvement. Section 6 discusses the practical application scenarios of ORLM and explores

future research directions based on the conclusions drawn in this paper. We conclude the paper in
Section 7.
2. Literature Review
Our research is related to several streams of literature, we will provide a detailed review of each
stream below.
AI approach for facilitating solution to operations research problems. With the fast
development of AI techniques, there have been a growing amount of research leveraging advanced
techniques, such as deep learning, to address challenging operational research (OR) problems
traditionally resistant to conventional methods. For example, in the supply chain context, Gijsbrechts
et al. (2022) employ deep reinforcement learning to enhance inventory management, demonstrating
parity with leading heuristics and approximate dynamic programming approaches. Qi et al. (2023)
investigate a data-driven multi-period inventory replenishment problem with uncertain demand and
vendor lead time, propose a one-step end-to-end framework that uses deep learning models to output
the suggested replenishment amount directly from input features. In the revenue management field,
Aouad and Désir (2022) propose a neural network-based discrete choice model called RUMnets,
which combines the theoretical robustness of traditional economic models with the flexibility and
learning capabilities of modern artificial intelligence approaches, leading to better predictions and
insights into consumer behavior. Wang et al. (2023a) explore the deployment of deep neural networks
in making the optimal assortment selection, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing consumer
choice. As for queuing theory, Dai and Gluzman (2022) investigate the deployment of advanced
policy gradient methods for controlling multi-class queueing networks, underscoring the superior
efficacy of the PPO algorithm under diverse load scenarios. For personalized recommendation, Wang
et al. (2023c) utilize a novel unsupervised deep learning network and graph embedding techniques to
improve recommendation accuracy and diversity by effectively transferring check-in patterns across
different geographical contexts. Regarding general Markov decision process, Zhang et al. (2021)
introduce a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that attains asymptotically optimal sample
complexity for learning an ϵ-optimal policy within discounted Markov decision processes (MDPs).
In addition, these techniques have been used in demand prediction, for example, Lee et al. (2024)
propose a Transformer-based methodology for time series conformal prediction, utilizing its decoder
to estimate prediction intervals through the quantile prediction of residuals, showcasing enhanced
performance over existing conformal prediction techniques. Chen et al. (2020) introduce a novel
architecture of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that significantly improves forecasting by

modeling the conditional distribution of future series data directly, rather than relying on traditional
autoregressive methods.
AI technology also demonstrates significant strengths in facilitating the implementation of opera-
tions research, for instance, Liu et al. (2023) employ reinforcement learning combined with spatial
data to optimize the allocation of resources and strategize for disease outbreak responses. Parmentier
(2022) introduces a novel paradigm that integrates machine learning with operations research to
efficiently approximate complex industrial problems by transforming them into classic, more tractable
optimization challenges.
In addition, there have also been recent attempts in using AI methods to empower optimization
algorithm design. For instance, deep learning or machine learning can be used to accelerate conven-
tional optimization algorithms for tackling mixed-integer programming problems (e.g., Chen et al.
2023c, Nair et al. 2020). Numerous researchers also explore end-to-end optimization problem-solving
strategies based on deep learning methods, motivated by the high structural similarity among many
optimization problems, with differences primarily in data distribution (e.g., Chen et al. 2022a, Khalil
et al. 2017). Compared to this work, the above stream of works studies the integration of AI approach
and traditional OR approaches in solving OR problems. In contrast, the main focus of the present
work is in the facilitation and automation of the modeling process of the optimization model, which
is different from the above stream.
Automated optimization modeling is an emerging area, which aims to automate mathematical
modeling and solving tasks to facilitate efficient decision-making. Recently, a growing body of studies
have emerged, aiming to bridge the gap between natural language processing and mathematical
optimization. One of the pioneering endeavors in this field is the NL4OPT competition, which
focuses on formulating mathematical models for optimization problems (Ramamonjison et al. 2023).
In particular, their work introduces a two-step framework using PLMs and offers a widely used
benchmark for intelligence mathematical modeling. Expanding on this, Xiao et al. (2023) introduce
Chain-of-Experts, a multi-agent LLM framework to build optimization model that significantly
outperforms GPT-4 by incorporating domain-specific knowledge and cooperative reasoning strategies.
AhmadiTeshnizi et al. (2024) propose OptiMUS, a robust LLM-based agent designed to formulate
and solve MILP problems. This system not only develops mathematical models but also assists
in writing and debugging solver code, showcasing a comprehensive solution that extends beyond
simple problem formulation. Similarly, Li et al. (2023a) develop a framework called OptiGuide which
leverages LLMs to interpret and explain optimization outcomes in supply chain management, thereby
enhancing stakeholder comprehension and trust. In terms of diagnosing and resolving optimization
issues, Chen et al. (2023a) introduce OptiChat, a natural language-based system equipped with

Huang et al.: ORLM: A Customizable Framework in Training Large Models for Automated Optimization Modeling

GPT-4, which assists in identifying and addressing infeasible optimization models. Unlike these
methods, our approach involves fine-tuning open-source LLMs and delivering a complete solution
using direct prompting, which is more concise and privacy-preserving than multi-agents interaction
and simply calling API from advanced LLMs like GPT-4.
Synthetic data plays a crucial role in enhancing the capabilities of large language models by
providing controlled, high-quality datasets that help fill gaps in real-world data, eliminate biases,
and improve model robustness. A review of literature on synthetic data and LLMs is referred to
Ding et al. (2024). In the field of synthetic data for optimization modeling, traditional methods
often require specialized knowledge to convert real-world problems into mathematical models, which
limits their accessibility and flexibility. Most research focuses on how to automatically generate
mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) models to overcome these challenges more effectively.
For example, the methods proposed by Pawlak and Krawiec (2017) and Sroka and Pawlak (2018)
utilize MILP examples for the synthesis of constraints. These methods develop an approach that can
generate constraints from examples of both feasible and infeasible solutions, thereby demonstrating
the feasibility of automating this conversion process. Further expanding on this theme, Pawlak and
O’Neill (2021) leverage evolutionary strategies to generate constraints that improve the adaptability
and efficiency of optimization models, thus enhancing the model’s flexibility in handling complex
scenarios. Prasath and Karande (2023) examine the effectiveness of synthesizing mathematical
programs from natural language specifications based on NL4OPT competition dataset, focusing on
data synthesis methods using the CodeT5 model with enhancements from data augmentation and
post-processing. The study highlights how synthetic data generation, notably through techniques
like reverse translation and parameter variation, significantly improves model performance in solving
optimization problems. The synthetic data framework proposed in Li et al. (2023b) leverages LLMs
to identify decision variables, classify constraints, and generate MILP models based on NL4OPT
problems. This approach significantly outperforms traditional methods, achieving higher accuracy
in constraint recognition and model formulation. In contrast to the aforementioned synthetic data
approaches, the method proposed in this paper is designed for the general purpose of synthesizing
high quality data for optimization modeling from unstructured natural language descriptions. This
allows for the development of synthesis strategies that are not only tailored to specific problem but
also capable of customized data augmentation.
3. Semi-Automated Framework for Data Generation
In this section, we present the formal definition of the optimization modeling task. We first discuss
some critical requirements for effectively training an open-source LLM to perform this task. Based


--- Page 10 ---
Huang et al.: ORLM: A Customizable Framework in Training Large Models for Automated Optimization Modeling
10
on these requirements, we design a semi-automated data synthesis framework OR-Instruct which
achieves the desired properties.
3.1. Data Requirements
Given an OR problem p described in natural language, optimization modeling (Berry and Houston
1995, AhmadiTeshnizi et al. 2024) involves constructing a mathematical model m that converts the
real-world problem into an optimization model with concrete decision variables, objective function
and constraints. Then, for large-scale problems, in order to obtain an optimal solution, we further
need to convert the mathematical model into a program c compatible with a specific optimization
solver. Hence, an expected training example for this task is usually required in the form of the triplet
(p,m,c), as illustrated in Figure 3. Training a large language model f for this task essentially involves
learning a function f : p →(m,c) that maps problems to their corresponding mathematical models
and solver programs. In this paper, without loss of generality, COPT is employed as the default
solver. COPT (Ge et al. 2022), an acronym for Cardinal Optimizer, is able to tackle large-scale
optimization problems and achieves good performance in a variety of tasks (Hans 2002). We select
the COPT solver because the predominant large language models available in the market have
not yet mastered the COPT syntax. This choice underscores the efficiency and extensibility of our
framework. However, any well-established solver may be utilized in the training dataset construction.
In addition to the desired format as described above, a desired training dataset should demonstrate
effectiveness, robustness, and practical applicability to real-world scenarios. In particular,
Requirement 1. Comprehensive Coverage: The dataset should cover: 1) diverse scenarios such
as supply chain optimization, scheduling, inventory management, and transportation logistics; 2)
different problem types like linear programming, integer programming, and mixed integer program-
ming; and 3) varying difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) — we provide a way to describe the
difficulty level of a problem in Appendix A.1.
Requirement 2. Environmental Adaptability: In real-world industrial settings, the objectives
and constraints of problems often change due to shifts in business goals, market conditions, or
resource availability. A good optimization model should be able to adapt to those changes easily.
Therefore, it is vital that the dataset includes cases reflecting these dynamic changes.
Requirement 3. Linguistic Diversity: Problems described in natural language often show
different syntax, ambiguities, and complexities. For example, one problem might mention "inventory
overflow" while another refers to "excess stock". Including this Linguistic Diversity in the dataset
could improve the model’s ability to understand varied descriptions.

Requirement 4. Technique Variability: For some challenging problems, there may be multiple
modeling techniques, such as linearizing a nonlinear problem by introducing auxiliary variables, or
introducing the big M term in an integer optimization formulation. Including this variety in the
dataset allows the model to learn different modeling techniques and approaches.
3.2. OR-Instruct: Towards Training Effective OR LLMs
In the above section, we describe some critical requirements on the dataset for an effective training
of an LLM to be equipped with good optimization modeling capabilities. However, collecting data on
a large scale that aligns with the above requirements presents significant challenges because: (1) such
data primarily resides within private industrial cases, and no public datasets sufficiently meet the
requirements, (2) training data suitable for optimization modeling is limited and requires extensive
time to collect, and (3) conventional synthesis methods (for example, Wang et al. 2022) encounter
substantial obstacles in generating this type of data, as will be elaborated below. In the following, to
address the above challenges, we design and implement OR-Instruct, a semi-automated process
for creating synthetic data tailored to these requirements. The overall pipeline of OR-Instruct is
depicted in Figure 2, which iteratively applies two strategies, namely expansion and augmentation,
to the training data pool, followed by the filtering of obviously low-quality data.
Initial Dataset
The quality of initial data plays a crucial role in large model training, providing
a strong foundation for diversity and difficulty as a starting point (Marion et al. 2023). Additionally,
in this customizable framework designed to enhance modeling capabilities, the category or domain
of the optimization problem associated with the initial data is important. We will demonstrate later
that when the initial dataset is concentrated in a specific type (e.g., scenario or type), it substantially
enhances the LLM’s ability to model effectively within that domain.
In our particular case, we start with 686 real-world industry cases collected from some OR
textbooks and our previous industrial projects (after proper abstraction and anonymization).
Strategy 1: Expansion for Comprehensive Coverage.
Initially, OR-Instruct seeks to
generate new data by expanding scenarios and question types from the training dataset using a
bootstrapping approach powered by GPT-4. The process begins with GPT-4 generating a list of
100 scenarios where optimization models are applied in real-life contexts. In each iteration, three
examples are selected from data pool to serve as in-context references for GPT-4, and one scenario
is randomly chosen from the list. Among the three examples, two are sourced from real-world data,
while the third, if available, is taken from data previously generated by the model. Finally, GPT-4 is
prompted to create a new sample based on the three examples within the context of the selected
scenario. This iterative approach promotes greater diversity in the resulting dataset. The prompting
template for this expansion process is detailed in Appendix A.2.


--- Page 13 ---
Huang et al.: ORLM: A Customizable Framework in Training Large Models for Automated Optimization Modeling
13
It’s important to note that optimization models are naturally abstract, often built on similar
logical ideas across various scenarios. In this setting, Comprehensive Coverage not only exposes
the LLMs to a broad range of situations but also helps it better grasp the underlying patterns and
principles when modeling across these different contexts. However, it falls short of meeting the other
requirements, especially concerning varying levels of difficulty. In manually reviewing the difficulty
of generated example, of 50 cases, 87% are deemed easy, 13% medium, and none hard, as judged
by criteria in Appendix A.1. We also provide examples in Appendix A.7 for comparing generated
easy entries with real-world hard entries. Fortunately, the original seed data already shows a diverse
range of difficulties. Thus, we can naturally enhance the difficulty diversity by augmenting them
described in the next strategy, thereby further addressing Comprehensive Coverage.
Strategy 2: Augmentation for Problem-Solution Diversity.
To fulfill the remaining
requirements, the OR-Instruct adopts an augmentation strategy for the original seed data, designed
to both enhance the diversity and robustness of the dataset while preserving the complexity inherent
in optimization modeling problems. This strategy is crafted to mirror potential scenarios that might
be encountered in real-world industrial applications, encompassing modifications such as alterations
in problem descriptions, model adjustments, or concurrent changes. To address these three scenarios,
the implementation of this strategy involves three specific tactics: rephrasing questions, modifying
objectives and constraints, and integrating diverse modeling techniques. Together, these tactics aim
to broaden the range of problem-solution diversity, thereby enriching the training dataset.
(a) Altering Objectives and Constraints: The first augmentation involves adding, removing, or
replacing objectives and constraints in the problem, along with making necessary adjustments
to the mathematical models and programs. Specifically, we start by providing GPT-4 with
the original example and ask it to list five potential changes to the objectives and constraints.
These suggested changes are then fed back to GPT-4 using a prepared few-shot prompt to
modify the problem, model, and programs accordingly. This augmentation is designed to
enhance Environmental Adaptability. An example is provided in Figure 4, and the corresponding
prompting template is shown in Appendix A.3.1.
Remark 1. One important point to note is that during the process of altering objectives and
constraints, GPT-4 may generate background scenarios that are illogical, such as presenting two
contradictory constraints. However, this issue arises from unreasonable problem descriptions. As
long as the model can accurately map each statement of the problem to the correct objectives
and constraints, it can still yield the desired results when tested on meticulously designed
datasets that reflect such issues.

An example illustrating altering objectives and constraints. Italicized text denotes altered content.
(b) Rephrasing Questions: The second augmentation involves modifying the problem description
while essentially addressing the same optimization model. This approach enhances the robustness
of large language models (LLMs) to different prompts, enabling them to abstract a unified
optimization model across various problem descriptions. This process involves instructing GPT-4
to rewrite the target problem, either simplifying or complicating it, while ensuring the core logic
aligns with the solution, including the mathematical model and programs. This augmentation
is designed to enhance Linguistic Diversity. An example is provided in Figure 5, and the
corresponding prompting template is shown in Appendix A.3.2.
Rephrasing Questions for Requirement 3
Original:
Q: A company has three transportation options to choose from to transport 25 tons of cargo, namely trucks,
airplanes, and ships with costs $100,$120,$130 per ton and capacities of 10,20,30 tons respectively. The
company can’t choose trucks and ships together. How should the company optimize the selection and allocation
of these methods to minimize overall costs?
Augmented:
Q: A corporation wants to transport 25 tons of cargo with least cost, and must choose from three transportation
modes: trucks, airplanes, and ships. These options cost $100, $120, and $130 per ton, respectively, with
capacities of 10, 20, and 30 tons. However, trucks and ships cannot be used together.

(c) Incorporating Multiple Modeling Techniques: The third augmentation explores the use of
different modeling techniques. We identify five potential techniques from engineers’ experiences,
such as introducing auxiliary variables or using the Big M method, for GPT-4 to choose from

is designed to enhance Solution Variability. An example is provided in Figure 6, and the

Postprocessing and Filtering
At the end of each iteration, OR-Instruct implements
correction and filtering measures on the generated examples. First, we apply a regular match
correction function to address minor grammatical errors in the programs, which may arise from
GPT-4’s limited familiarity with the COPT API. Unexecutable programs are discarded, as they
clearly represent low-quality data. Notably, in the final iteration, we also eliminate duplicate questions
and any examples overlapping with the evaluation benchmarks to ensure the dataset remains
uncontaminated.
Based on manual sampling assessments, we find that the accuracy of the synthesized data by
expansion operation is about 70% and 75% for the augmentation data, judged by the correctness
of both the code and the model. On average, each iteration filters out approximately 39% of the
generated examples, with the remaining examples incorporated into our training data pool.
In summary, the above outlines all the key steps of OR-Instruct, and the specific procedures can
be found in Figure 2.
4. Results
In this section, we train the open-source 7b size large language models with synthetic data from OR-
Instruct and compare the results with GPT-4 as well as other benchmarks. Then, using the case
of mixed integer linear programming as an example, we demonstrate the customized enhancement
effect of OR-Instruct by including directionally generated training data.

4.1. Data Generation by Using OR-Instruct
In our experiment, we initiate the study with 686 cases derived from previous industry projects,
which the team engages with previously. These cases are abstracted and anonymized appropriately.
Throughout the OR-Instruct process, we utilize the proprietary LLM gpt-4-0613 as the standard
model. For each cycle, the training data pool undergoes an expansion procedure 20,000 times and
each augmentation operation is applied 6,000 times. Subsequently, an automatic filtration system
excludes low-quality entries. After completing two iterations of this framework, we amass a total of
32,481 training examples.

Statistics: Figure 7 presents the statistics of the OR-Instruct Data. Of the data, 57% is generated
by the expansion operation, 17.2% by the augmentation of altering objectives and constraints, 15.3%
by the augmentation of rephrasing questions, and 10.5% by the augmentation of incorporating
multiple modeling techniques. For scenario diversity, we have abstracted 16 industries from a total of
1,556 expanded scenarios to facilitate their representation in a plot. Regarding question type diversity,
it expands to 8 question types. In terms of data quality, the accuracy of correctness are 70% for
expansion data and 75% for augmentation data. We find these accuracy acceptable in exchange for
automatic filtering and more cost-effective data synthesis. Additionally, our preliminary experiments
have demonstrated the benefits of incorporating such data.
4.2. Model Finetuning and Inference
This paper employs instruction tuning for open-source large models, a technique designed to enhance
the ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow diverse natural language instructions. The
primary aim is to improve zero-shot performance on unseen tasks, facilitating effective generalization
across various instruction-based scenarios. The methodology involves training on a dataset of
instruction-output pairs, typically consisting of three elements: an instruction (e.g., "Translate this


--- Page 17 ---
Huang et al.: ORLM: A Customizable Framework in Training Large Models for Automated Optimization Modeling
17
sentence from English to Spanish"), optional context, and the target output. The training can be
mathematically represented as:
L(θ) = −
X
(x,y)∈D
log P(y | x;θ)
where L(θ) is the loss function, x is the instruction input, y is the expected output, and θ denotes
the model parameters. We borrow a widely used training framework from open-instruct (Wang et al.
2023d), where we take a natural language OR problem wrapped in an Alpaca-like template (Taori
et al. 2023.) as the input prompt (see Appendix A.4), and treat a complete solution including
mathematical models and programs as the target completion.
During training, we compute the loss only over the target completion. We employ the OR-
Instruct dataset to train several open-source large language models (LLMs) of approximately 7
billion parameters, including Mistral-7B (Jiang et al. 2023), Deepseek-Math-7B-Base (Shao et al.
2024), and LLaMA-3-8B (AI@Meta 2024), which serve as our backbone models. We conduct a
grid hyper-parameter search for each backbone and present the best-performing hyperparameters in
Table 1. 1 The models resulting from this process are referred to as ORLMs.
Regarding the inference techniques during evaluation, it is important to consider that large
language models, as probabilistic generative models, exhibit inherent randomness. This randomness
can lead to inconsistent outcomes across multiple evaluations. To mitigate the influence of this
randomness, we implemented a greedy decoding strategy in a zero-shot scenario, consistently selecting
the highest probability output (top-1) as the final result. After obtaining these results, we executed
the corresponding code to derive the predicted optimal values for comparison with the ground truth.
Although this greedy approach may reduce the performance of large models on such tasks, it ensures
the stability of the output and enables the reproducibility of our findings under identical conditions.
We will discuss the impact of employing additional inference techniques on the performance of large
models in Section 5.4.

4.3. Evaluation and Baselines
Evaluation Benchmarks and Metrics: We use NL4OPT (Ramamonjison et al. 2023.),
MAMO (Huang et al. 2024b.), and IndustryOR as evaluation benchmarks. NL4OPT is the most
widely used benchmark for operations research and includes 289 linear programming problems in its
test set. However, NL4OPT only provides mathematical models as targets, which complicates the
verification of execution accuracy due to the absence of optimal solutions. To address this, we convert
these mathematical models into programs using GPT-4, calculate and check the optimal solutions,
and use these as ground truth. MAMO, a concurrent project, evaluates the mathematical modeling
capabilities in LLMs. It includes 652 easy and 211 complex linear programming problems, each paired
with its corresponding optimal solution, sourced from various academic materials. IndustryOR, which
is proposed in this work, is the first industrial benchmark, consisting of 100 real-world OR problems
from eight industries. It covers 5 types of questions, linear programming, integer programming, mixed
integer programming, non-linear programming, and others across 3 levels of difficulty. We measure
performance using execution accuracy, where an executed optimal value that matches any provided
ground truth optimal value is considered correct. Compared to NL4OPT, this metric enables a fully
automated evaluation and provides greater flexibility for mathematical modeling approaches.
Baselines: To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we select a diverse set of models from previous
methods for comparison. We include tag-BART (Kani and Gangwar 2022), which secured the first
place in the NeurIPS competition (Ramamonjison et al. 2022). Additionally, we consider methods
that utilize proprietary LLMs. The "standard" prompting method involves prompting a proprietary
LLM to produce mathematical programs, serving as a fundamental baseline. We also incorporate
complex prompt engineering methods such as Reflexion (Shinn et al. 2023), Chain-of-Experts (Xiao
et al. 2023), and OptiMUS (AhmadiTeshnizi et al. 2024). These methods employ agents to refine
both mathematical models and programs, achieving good performances on NL4OPT. We report
their performance based on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, respectively. Note that we implement the standard
prompting on IndustryOR using the toolkit released by Chain-of-Experts (Xiao et al. 2023).
In addition, we introduce the most well-known open-source large models for comparison, including
Llama-3.1-lnstruct (Dubey et al. 2024), DeepSeek-v2-Chat (DeepSeek AI 2024), DeepSeek-R1 (Guo
et al. 2025), Qwen2-Instruct (Qwen Team 2024), and Mistral-Nemo (Mistral AI 2024). Each model
is tasked with constructing optimization models and generating code to solve the test set problems.
We also assess the difference between the performance of ORLM and human-level performance.
Given that constructing and solving optimization models requires a solid foundation in operations
research and programming skills, we recruit 8 highly capable senior undergraduate students from
relevant fields and 8 experts in the domain to evaluate four types of test sets. Each test set is


--- Page 19 ---
Huang et al.: ORLM: A Customizable Framework in Training Large Models for Automated Optimization Modeling
19
evaluated by 2 senior undergraduate students and 2 experts. Each participant randomly selects 70
questions from their corresponding test set and is required to construct an optimized model and
calculate the optimal solution. Participants are allowed to use any programming language; however,
to ensure fairness in comparison with large models, they are only permitted to submit a finalized
version of their code for testing and cannot make further modifications. Finally, the accuracy rates
for the student and expert groups on each test set are obtained by averaging the results.

The results are presented in Table 2. First, it is clear that methods based on LLMs generally
outperform the PLM-based best method (tag-BART) in the NL4OPT test. This suggests that
PLMs have limited generalization capabilities. For proprietary LLMs, as the mathematical reasoning
capability increases from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4, we observe that performance has advanced across all
prompt engineering methods.

Our best-performing ORLMs, like ORLM-LLaMA-3 and ORLM-Qwen2.5, achieve state-of-the-art
performance across four benchmarks with respect to GPT-4 and other open-source LLMs2, surpassing
Standard prompting based on GPT-4 by 42.2% in micro average3 and 55.4% in macro average4 A
comparison with human evaluation results reveals that ORLMs outperform senior undergraduate
students on simpler problems (NL4OPT/MAMO-EasyLP) and approach expert-level performance.
However, for more complex problems (IndustryOR/MAMO-ComplexLP), ORLMs still underperform
relative to the average student, indicating that their problem-solving capabilities for complex tasks
remain inadequate. We will analyze the underlying reasons for this in Section 5, highlighting that
ORLMs still have the potential to surpass student performance and approach expert-level solutions
on more challenging problems.
While ORLMs demonstrate strong performance in optimization modeling tasks, we also evaluate
their efficacy on general large language model benchmarks after domain-specific fine-tuning. In
particular, we conduct a rigorous evaluation of the LLaMA-3-8B model (pre-fine-tuning) and the
ORLM-LLaMA-3-8B model (post-fine-tuning) following the open-instruct (Wang et al. 2023d) on
benchmarks from various domains, including mathematics (GSM8K), code (HumanEval), and general
knowledge (MMLU, BBH, TydiQA), the results are listed in Table 3.

The results reveal that ORLM-LLaMA-3-8B exhibits improved performance in the mathematics and
coding domains, which aligns with expectations, as the OR-Instruct data emphasizes mathematical
modeling and coding with solver assistance. However, the model exhibits a slight decline in general
domain performance. Overall, the average performance across all domains shows no substantial
deviation.
A comparative study on problem-solving efficiency. To verify the effectiveness of ORLM
in human–AI collaboration, we conduct a comparative experiment to demonstrate its impact on
2 Due to the severe scarcity of API resources, we are unable to conduct large-scale modeling tests on many state-of-
the-art LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1 (671B).
3 Micro average aggregates the outcomes of all classes to compute the metrics, heavily weighing the classes with more
instances. This method is effective for evaluating the overall effectiveness of the model, particularly in datasets where
some classes significantly outnumber others.
4 Macro average calculates individual metrics for each class without regard to class frequency, and then averages these
metrics, treating all classes with equal importance. This approach highlights model performance on minority classes
and is beneficial for assessing model fairness across diverse class distributions.

algorithm engineers in solving practical problems. Specifically, we recruit a group of 30 people,
consisting of experts and senior undergraduate students, dividing them evenly into two groups, A
and B. Each group comprises 7 experts and 8 undergraduate students, with comparable proficiency
levels. We design 7 problems with varying difficulty levels, ranging from textbook exercises to
those approximating industrial complexity. Group A is tasked with independently modeling and
programming the solutions without the aid of ORLM, while Group B utilizes ORLM for problem-
solving and programming. We assess the effectiveness of ORLM based on two dimensions: accuracy
and solution time. The results are presented in Figure 8. We acknowledge that the sample size of
the experiment is limited due to the difficulty of finding suitable subjects; nevertheless, we perform
statistical analysis on the limited data and find that the comparison is still statistically significant.

Table 4 shows the results of our statistical analysis. Specifically, for each metric (difference in
accuracy for total/experts/students, difference in time for total/experts/students), we first select an
appropriate statistical test based on the distributional properties of the data, as indicated in the third
column of the table. For solution time of each subgroup, we find that the distribution successfully
passes the normality test and meets the assumption of homogeneity of variance. Consequently, we
employ a standard t-test for statistical analysis. In contrast, for accuracy, the distribution does not
conform to normality; therefore, we utilize the Mann-Whitney U test as a non-parametric alternative
(see Hogg et al. 2019 for reference). Subsequently, we compute the test statistic and the corresponding
p-value for each test, which are reported in the 4th and 5th columns, respectively. We also calculate
the 95% confidence interval for the difference between the two groups based on each test and present
the results in the 6th column.
To further demonstrate the robustness of our results, the last two columns provide additional
analyses, including the effect size (Hedge’s g) and the statistical power (Cohen 2013). Notably,


--- Page 22 ---

Hedge’s g is independent of sample size, making it a more objective measure of the generalizability
and strength of the statistical significance. Meanwhile, statistical power serves as an indicator of the
reliability and accuracy of our results. The detailed testing procedures and statistical indicators are
provided in Appendix A.6.

For Table 4, we can see that at a 95% confidence level, the use of ORLM significantly improves
both solution time and accuracy across all populations (total, expert, and student samples). The
confidence intervals suggest that, after implementing ORLM, accuracy improves by approximately
10%–25%. Additionally, the total time saved in solving optimization modeling problems is 1.8–2.2
hours, with experts saving approximately 1.5–2 hours and students saving around 2–2.5 hours. The
absolute value of Hedge’s g > 1 indicates a substantial effect size, highlighting a large difference
between experimental and control groups. Additionally, statistical power > 0.8, ensuring a high
probability of detecting a true effect and minimizing Type II error risk.
In addition, we collect feedback from engineers on their experience using ORLM, as shown in Table
5. None of the engineers rate ORLM as "useless" or "minimal help". Instead, the majority provide
highly positive evaluations ("significant help" or "highly effective"), indicating that ORLM is both
efficient and effective in assisting their work. These demonstrate the significant potential of ORLM
to enhance the application of operations research in industry through human–AI collaboration. We
will further discuss the application value of ORLM in Section 6.1.

4.4. Customization Enhancement
In this subsection, we illustrate the capability of our framework to enhance large models in specific
areas by generating targeted types of optimization modeling data. Specifically, we focus on the scenario
of mixed integer linear programming (MILP). We provide an empirical example demonstrating how
the quality of responses improves with training. Initially, we use a base dataset comprising 10,000
general modeling cases. To enhance the ORLM’s proficiency in MILP, we selected 50 fundamental
MILP questions and their answers for inclusion in the seed data pool. After several iterative rounds,
this process yields 2,000 tailored training data points for MILP. We will subsequently assess the
impact of incorporating these 2,000 data points into the training dataset by comparing the ORLM’s
performance before and after their addition.

To help the toy manufacturer maximize profit, we need 
to construct an integer programming model to 
determine the optimal production mix. Below is the 
model construction:

As depicted in Figure 9, in response to the scenario presented in Figure 1, GPT-4 inaccurately
interprets logical relationships as quantitative ones and includes nonlinear terms during the modeling
process as shown in the red area, adversely affecting solver performance. A similar mistake is observed
in the general ORLM, which also misinterprets logical relationships as quantitative. In contrast, the

targeted-trained ORLM accurately transforms the problem into a correct mathematical model by
utilizing indicator variables and the Big M method. This showcases the robust generalization capa-
bility of OR-Instruct. Furthermore, OR-Instruct not only facilitates customized improvements
across different modeling types but also demonstrates potential for targeted enhancements within
specific industrial sectors.
5. Analysis and Discussion
5.1. Detailed Comparison of ORLM vs GPT-4 on IndustryOR
To assess the optimization modeling capabilities across different levels of difficulty and question
types, we compare the accuracy rate of ORLM-LLaMA-3-8B and Standard-GPT-4 on IndustryOR, as
shown in Figure 10. ORLM-LLaMA-3-8B shows superior performance over Standard-GPT-4 across all
difficulty levels, especially in the hard category. Regarding different question types, ORLM-LLaMA-
3-8B outperforms Standard-GPT-4 in linear programming, integer programming, and mixed-integer
programming. Both models perform poorly in non-linear programming and other rare question
types. This is partly due to the fact that the seed dataset collected contains too few examples of
nonlinear and other types of optimization modeling, resulting in a low percentage of that type in the
training dataset, and partly due to the fact that the inherent complexity and scarcity of these types
of questions. Overall, the OR-Instruct data proves effective in enhancing Comprehensive Coverage
across various question types and difficulty levels.

5.2. Ablation Study
Ablation Study on Data Synthesis Strategy
We first assess whether the data generated by
OR-Instruct truly leads to improvements in the Seed data, particularly in terms of the performance
of the ORLM. Particularly, we compare the performance of fine-tuning on seed data alone with the
results of fine-tuning on OR-Instruct-generated data based on the same seed data. We observe that,
with the exception of minor variations in simpler linear programming cases (MAMO_EasyLP), the
OR-Instruct-generated data yield a significant performance boost for ORLM than only using the
seed data as shown in Table 6.

Ablation Study on OR-Instruct Augmentations
To further verify the effectiveness of
the augmentations in OR-Instruct, we conduct detailed ablation experiments to study the effects
of altering objectives and constraints, rephrasing questions, and incorporating multiple modeling
techniques. Specifically, we construct four distinct datasets, each comprising 3,000 instances, drawn
from the OR-Instruct data but employing different augmentation strategies. These datasets
are then utilized to train the LLaMA-3-8B model, maintaining consistent hyperparameters across
all experimental conditions. The results are presented in Table 7. Training data with all three
augmentations (denoted as Full Augmentations) achieves a base performance of 68.6% in micro
average and 55.7% in macro average. Removing any of the three augmentations from the base setting
leads to a performance drop across all benchmarks, both in micro and macro averages. Rephrasing
questions seems slightly more important than the other two. Overall, the results show that all three
augmentations contribute to general performance, proving their effectiveness in enhancing the data
diversity.

Ablation Study on Question Types
ORLM can be tailored to specific domains within the
field of optimization, depending on its initial training dataset. A key consideration in this process
is whether incorporating data from other domains is necessary. This investigation aims to provide
valuable guidance for implementing ORLM in specialized areas.
We use linear programming as a case study, comparing ORLM’s performance when trained solely
on linear programming data versus a mixed dataset including other problem types. Specifically, we
construct two training sets, each comprising 7,049 instances: one set exclusively consisting of pure
linear programming (LP) problems, and the other comprising a diverse mixture of problem types5
We fine-tune the Meta-Llama3 8B model on both datasets, ensuring that hyper-parameter settings
remain consistent across experiments. The test performance is summarized in Table 8:

As illustrated in Table 8, even with identical test sizes, the inclusion of mixed problem types
significantly enhances the performance of the ORLM-LLaMA-3-8B across various datasets. Notably,
when examining the tests focused on linear programming, specifically MAMO-EasyLP and MAMO-
ComplexLP, it is evident that integrating additional problem types is more effective in enhancing
the ORLM’s performance on challenging linear programming problems. A plausible explanation for
this phenomenon is that the incorporation of a broader variety of problems effectively strengthens
the generalization ability of the ORLM-LLaMA-3-8B, allowing it to capture a wider modeling capacity
and consequently improve modeling performance (See Dong et al. 2023).
5.3. Scaling Laws
The concept of scaling laws is a key element in the development of large models. It refers to the
phenomenon that the performance of large language models improves as their size and complexity
increase. In this section, we will examine the impact of scaling laws on ORLMs from two dimensions:
training data and model size.
From the perspective of training data, we begin with seed data and subsequently randomly
sample a predetermined number of training data from the data generated by OR-Instruct. Using
the LLaMA-3-8B model as the base, we conduct training while keeping all other hyperparameters

27
constant (as in Table 1), in order to observe the performance of ORLM-LLaMA-3-8B on various
test sets. Regarding model size, we focus on the Qwen large model series, as it offers a more refined
range of model sizes that are compatible with our hardware limitations (0.5B, 1.5B, 3B, 7B, 14B).
We fix the training dataset to be all data generated by OR-Instruct. Under the condition of identical
training hyperparameters, we observe the performance of different Qwen2.5 model sizes on various
test sets. In our study, we use the overall macro average and micro average across four test sets as
metrics to evaluate the performance of the ORLMs, as visualized in Figure 11. More detailed results
are provided in Appendix A.5.2.

Scaling law validation across different data and model sizes
The figure clearly shows an upward trend in ORLM’s accuracy on the test sets as either the model
size or the data volume increases. However, the impact of these two types of scaling laws on ORLM’s
performance differs. Specifically, increasing the training set size results in fluctuating performance
gains from the macro average metric, this is because for simple test datasets (NL4OPT and MAMO-
easyLP), ORLM quickly reaches a performance bottleneck and begins to fluctuate, causing instability
in its accuracy across the entire dataset. For micro average metric, the overall performance continues
to exhibit a monotonic increase with the expansion of training data, approximately following a
power-law trend. This indicates that increasing the amount of training data remains beneficial for
improving the model’s capabilities.
Regarding the scaling law for model size, it is evident that increasing the model size significantly
enhances ORLM’s accuracy. This increase not only yields steady incremental gains but also follows
a power-law trend, consistent with the findings reported by Kaplan et al. (2020). This indicates that
the intrinsic capability of the base model establishes a higher performance ceiling for ORLMs in
optimization modeling tasks.

5.4. Inference Techniques
In previous model evaluations, we employed a greedy inference strategy to ensure the replicability
and fairness of the results. However, using greedy sampling entails always selecting the word with
the highest probability from the large model’s output during each generation. While this approach
guarantees deterministic results, it also limits the model’s diversity and creativity. To address this, in
this section, we will utilize more common sampling techniques to assess the performance improvements
of the ORLMs. Specifically, we adjust the following two parameters: First, the temperature parameter
controls the diversity of the generated text. Higher temperature values increase the randomness
and creativity of the generated content, while lower values tend to produce more deterministic text.
Second, the top-P parameter restricts the range of vocabulary choices considered by the model during
generation. A higher top-P value means the model will consider a broader set of candidate words,
thus enhancing the diversity of the generated content. To avoid excessive randomness that may lead
to significant fluctuations in the accuracy of the generated results, we apply Pass@k (k = 2,4,8)
strategy to enhance stability. Specifically, for each query, the large model generates top k candidate
answers, and as long as at least one of the top k answers is correct, it is considered to have answered
this question correctly (Pass@k). This approach helps improve the consistency and stability of the
generated outcomes. The test results is detailed in Table 9.

Significant improvements have been observed in ORLMs across four test sets, with the overall
micro average of Pass@8 increasing by 17.09% relative to the previous version, while the macro
average rose by 24.34%. A comparison with Table 2 reveals that, in terms of both macro average and
micro average accuracy, the ORLM under the Pass@8 strategy has already surpassed the accuracy
of senior undergraduate students and is approaching that of experts. This highlights the significant
potential of ORLMs to serve as a viable alternative to human engineers. The high Pass@8 score


--- Page 29 ---
Huang et al.: ORLM: A Customizable Framework in Training Large Models for Automated Optimization Modeling
29
indicates that the correct answer is often found within the top 8 solutions. However, the model’s
greedy decoding strategy remains insufficiently effective to consistently prioritize the optimal answer.
The notable progress between the Pass@1 and Pass@8 scores suggests that while the model has the
potential to generate correct solutions, its ranking capability is currently inadequate to reliably place
the optimal solution in the first position. Fortunately, reinforcement learning may offer a promising
solution to bridge the gap between Pass@1 and Pass@8, we will discuss it in the future work (See
Section 6.2).
5.5. Limitations Analysis
Building upon the previous discussion and results, this section concludes with an analysis of the
current limitations of ORLM. First, using ORLM-Llama-3-8B as a case study, we present a statistical
breakdown of error types under the greedy inference strategy, as shown in Table 10.

In the table above, the "Overall Percentage" represents the occurrence frequency of each error type
across all test sets, while the "Error Percentage" indicates the proportion of each error type within
the total number of errors. The data reveals that, ORLM has demonstrated considerable proficiency
in utilizing COPT, achieving a pass rate of approximately 95% across more than 1,000 test cases.
Consequently, the primary challenges lie in the optimization modeling phase of the process.
To analyze the types of errors occurring in ORLM modeling, we randomly selected 100 problems
from those where ORLM failed. Following manual evaluation and statistical analysis, and after
excluding errors caused by coding issues, we categorized the modeling-related errors into three
primary types, as detailed in Table 11. Notably, the predominant cause of ORLM’s modeling errors
is "Low Model Completeness", which accounts for more than half of the observed errors. Further
analysis reveals that this issue stems from the limitations in the expressive and learning capabilities
of 8B-scale models. These models often produce overly simplified outputs in complex scenarios,
reducing the intricacy of optimization modeling problems even when such scenarios are included
in the training set. This highlights the importance of fine-tuning larger-scale models, a conclusion
supported by our scaling law experiments.
Although ORLM still has certain limitations, as demonstrated by previous experimental results,
we recognize substantial opportunities for improvement through the application of scaling laws,

different inference techniques and others. ORLM is still promising in addressing complex optimization
modeling problems, even certain real-world industrial problems within specific domains. In the next
section, we will demonstrate how ORLM can be applied to practical scenarios such as industrial
production, education, and other real-world applications.
6. Future Direction
In previous sections, we conduct a detailed analysis of ORLM’s strengths and limitations within the
field of optimization modeling. In this section, we build on above experimental results to discuss the
practical applications of ORLM and potential directions for future improvement.
6.1. Potential Applications
Large language models are increasingly influential across various industries, and the rise of privatized
and domain-specific LLMs presents new topics for management. This work represents the first
attempt to fine-tune open-source LLMs specifically for optimization modeling. The ORLM not only
surpasses the performance of cutting-edge proprietary models but also ensures privacy, security,
and stability for commercial applications. Additionally, its 7B size allows for private deployment
on personal computers with only 16GB of VRAM, making operations research more accessible to a
wider audience. We hope that this work could shed lights on the deep integration of large language
models with operations research and management science. Potential applications are listed as follows:
1. Revolutionizing the role of operations research in industry: In recent years, operations
research has rapidly permeated various industrial sectors, supporting companies in making
more informed and effective decisions. However, optimization modeling tasks in industry often
encounter two critical challenges: (1) optimization models are typically not robust enough to
withstand changes in external conditions. When the environment shifts, models must be quickly
adjusted to help companies make timely decisions under new circumstances; (2) optimization
projects typically rely on business experts to specify goals and constraints, while algorithm
engineers are responsible for developing and solving the models. For many specialized industrial

Huang et al.: ORLM: A Customizable Framework in Training Large Models for Automated Optimization Modeling
31
problems, communication between these two roles can be costly. Algorithm engineers may
struggle to grasp the intricacies of business logic, and business experts often lack technical
modeling expertise.
The introduction of ORLM could help address many of these challenges. Particularly, compa-
nies with extensive training data can customize ORLMs to their domain based on OR-Instruct.
As demonstrated in Tables 2 and 3, ORLM significantly enhances optimization modeling
capabilities while retaining the broad knowledge acquired during pre-training. This allows it
to quickly grasp industry-specific terminology and facilitate effective communication between
business experts and algorithm engineers. ORLM operates with remarkable efficiency, gener-
ating an initial solution within seconds that both engineers and business teams can refer to.
Given ORLM’s strong performance on Pass@8 metrics, it can also produce multiple solutions,
supporting selection and comparison, which accelerates project iterations. Two representative
workflows are illustrated in Figure 12.

can then validate. This capability not only reduces delivery costs but also improves accuracy on
complex tasks.
Beyond these capabilities, ORLM has the potential to leverage Retrieval-Augmented Genera-
tion (RAG) and similar technologies to incorporate internal company documents, evolving into
a domain-specific optimization expert well-versed in the company’s field. This feature allows
ORLM to support knowledge transfer and updates, transforming traditional project reports
into valuable data assets for future model training. In addition to project delivery, ORLM can
also be applied in training junior algorithm engineers in modeling techniques, further enhancing
its value within the enterprise.
2. Operations research education: The outstanding performance of ORLM in fundamental
optimization modeling problems makes it sufficiently capable of addressing the modeling
challenges encountered by beginners in operations research. Instructors can utilize ORLM for
efficient instructional guidance, allowing students to quickly derive reference solutions and
processes for unfamiliar operations research modeling problems, thereby enhancing teaching
efficiency and quality.
3. Mathematical modeling competitions: As one of the most influential competitions, math-
ematical modeling contests aim to cultivate students’ abilities to solve problems using math-
ematical knowledge. Since 2023, several mathematical modeling competitions have begun to
acknowledge the significant role of generative AI in modeling, permitting its use as an aid (e.g.,
MCM 2024). The capabilities of ORLM position it as a powerful tool in such competitions.
4. Reducing the learning cost of solvers: Solvers are a core component of optimization
modeling problems, yet the diverse programming syntax of different solvers significantly increases
the learning cost for users, hindering their widespread adoption. The emergence of ORLM marks
a pivotal shift in this regard. Notably, Table 10 indicates that ORLM rarely encounters errors
due to coding issues (95% accuracy rate), even with less common syntax such as that specific
to COPT. This suggests that algorithm engineers can confidently develop reliable operations
research models and rely on ORLM to translate them into corresponding solver code, alleviating
the need to extensively learn solver syntax.
6.2. Future Research Directions
In Section 5, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the current limitations of ORLM and to
investigate the underlying causes. Based on our findings, we propose directions for future improve-
ments, calling for community attention and collaboration to drive progress in this field:
• Incorporating sophisticated techniques: In Section 5.4, we observe that while ORLM can
generate correct answers, it struggles with ranking them effectively. Incorporating reinforcement

learning techniques could help narrow the gap between pass@1 and pass@8 scores. As noted
by Sutton and Barto (2018), one of the primary goals of reinforcement learning is to align
the policy with the Bellman optimality policy, effectively optimizing ranking quality. In this
context, relevant methods like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), direct
preference optimization (DPO), and Kahneman-Tversky optimization (KTO) aim to minimize
the disparity between the model’s current greedy decoding policy and the Bellman optimality
policy, thereby enhancing the model’s ranking accuracy and moving pass@1 closer to pass@8. In
addition, approaches such as multi-agent collaboration and internal chain of thought structures
similar to o1 (OpenAI 2024) could further enhance the performance of current large models in
optimization modeling tasks.
• Dataset construction: While this paper presents a data synthesis strategy, it is insufficient
for reinforcement learning techniques like RLHF, which require training data in the form of a
preference list. For each question, multiple responses must be ranked according to preference.
Furthermore, in the context of optimization problems, incorporating actual optimal solutions
into the training set would enable a wider range of techniques. Constructing such datasets may
require user’s feedback or the development of new data synthesis methods to better meet these
needs.
• Data mining and exploration: As shown in Figure 11, we have demonstrated that scaling
laws significantly benefit ORLM. However, for a fixed model size, the performance gains from
additional data become increasingly marginal at later stages. This raises the question of whether
it is possible to identify an optimized, minimal dataset or develop efficient data synthesis
strategies that can balance ORLM’s performance with the associated training costs. Existing
studies (e.g., Chen et al. 2023b) indicate that only a small portion of a complete dataset is often
sufficient to achieve comparable performance. Therefore, developing a tailored data exploration
strategy for optimization problem modeling, which minimizes the reliance on large-scale data
resources for enhancing large models, represents an important direction for future research.
7. Concluding Remarks
In this paper, we propose a new path for the training of open-source large language models (LLMs)
specifically tailored for optimization modeling. We characterize four critical requirements essential for
the training dataset of optimization modeling LLMs and develop OR-Instruct, a semi-automated
framework for generating synthetic data that meets these specific needs. Additionally, we introduce
the IndustryOR benchmark, the first of its kind in the industry. We utilize the OR-Instruct data
to train open-source LLMs with approximately 7 billion parameters, which significantly enhances
their optimization modeling capabilities, achieving competitive performance across all test datasets.

This paper also identifies the current limitations of ORLM, such as its overly simplistic output
for complex problems, weak ability to rank optimal solutions, and poor learning capability from
data. Our experiments suggest that ORLM can be further enhanced by leveraging scaling laws
or incorporating methods such as reinforcement learning (RL), potentially reaching expert-level
performance. We hope these findings provide valuable insights for the future advancement of ORLM’s
applications in industry and open promising avenues for subsequent research.
Finally, we note that during the revision process of this paper, numerous high-performing large
models have emerged, such as DeepSeek-R1 and Grok-3. While these new models demonstrate
impressive capabilities, further enhancing their performance in optimization modeling requires
additional refinement. The framework proposed in this paper offers a valuable reference for such
improvements, including synthesizing high-quality data to strengthen modeling comprehension,
or considering reinforcement learning strategies to align ranking capabilities. By leveraging our
framework as a promising starting point, the inherent strengths of large models can be more effectively
translated into optimization modeling capabilities.

Models for Automated Optimization Modeling
Online Supplement
Appendix A: Appendix
A.1. Criteria for Difficulty Level of Problem
We need to first highlight that the difficulty associated with optimization modeling is inherently
challenging to quantify. Unlike solving optimization problems that can be assessed based on the
number of variables, constraints, or model forms, the complexity of optimization modeling arises
in enabling a large model to learn the mapping from natural language to optimized models. This
difficulty primarily relates to the model’s reasoning abilities and its capacity for abstracting complex
problem descriptions.
Nevertheless, this study adopts a heuristic approach to assess the difficulty of modeling problems.
We propose four evaluation criteria and provide illustrative examples of problem difficulty (see
Appendix A.7). Using these criteria and specific examples, GPT-4 independently evaluates the
difficulty level of each problem, ultimately categorizing them into three levels: easy, medium, and
hard. The four criteria considered in this study are as follows:
1. Problem size: This includes the number of constraints, objectives, and variables described in
the natural language problem. Generally, the larger the problem, the higher the complexity of
the model. (As shown in the statistical data in Figure 13, we sample 100 instances for each
of the three difficulty levels from the training dataset. The average numbers of variables and
constraints in these samples align with the proposed evaluation criteria.)
2. Complex and logical relationships: The complexity of relationships between variables and the
logical structure of objective functions and constraints significantly affect modeling difficulty.
Problems involving intricate logical conditions, such as "if-else" statements, "or" conditions,
and nonlinear functions, increase the challenge of formulating precise mathematical models.
3. Ambiguity and complexity of natural language description: Natural language descriptions often
contain ambiguous or polysemous expressions, which complicate the task of translating them
into precisely defined mathematical models. Ambiguities in wording, implicit constraints, and
unclear priorities require additional clarification and assumptions for accurate modeling.
4. Requirement for interdisciplinary knowledge: Certain natural language problems may encompass
specific domain knowledge (e.g., economics, engineering, biology), necessitating the application
of expertise from these fields for accurate modeling. This requires not only operations research
skills but also an interdisciplinary understanding, thereby increasing the complexity of the
modeling process.

This figure illustrates the statistical data obtained after sampling 100 problems for each of the
three difficulty levels from the training dataset. First, the proportion of optimization problems with
determined parameters is calculated and presented by the yellow line. For this type, the average
number of constraints and variables is computed and visualized as a bar chart. For problems with
undetermined parameters (parameters such as the number of warehouses can be manually designed,
refer to example provided in Appendix A.7.3), only the proportion is calculated and represented by the
red line.
A.2. Prompt Template for Expansion
Description:
In the Expansion phase, we design two prompts to enhance the effectiveness of the model.
The first prompt aims to generate a sufficiently broad range of operations research scenarios and
industries, serving as a reference for large language model to expand scenarios. The second prompt
leverages the few-shot learning capability of the model, using three sample data points to generate
a specific optimization problem within new operations research scenario. The new scenario is
derived from the result produced by the first prompt. The term highlighted in the black box,
select from the scenario list , in the second prompt refers to the process of randomly selecting a
scenario from the output generated by the first prompt.
Scenario Generation Prompt:
Please list 100 specific application scenarios or industries where optimization modeling are utilized. These

and environment, healthcare, transportation, finance and insurance, agriculture, and military defense. Each

#Problem#:
A leather shoe store employs 5 full-time salespersons and 4 part-time salespersons. In order to optimize
the working environment and consider employee health, the store decides to limit the overtime hours of each
full-time employee. The following table shows the working hours and wage information for the employees:
| | Monthly Working Hours | Sales (pairs/hour) | Wage (dollars/hour) | Overtime Pay (dollars/hour) |

Our objective is to evaluate whether the use of the ORLM tool leads to significant improvements
in both time efficiency and accuracy for students and experts, respectively. Accordingly, we formulate
the null and alternative hypotheses as follows:
• Null Hypothesis H0: There is no significant difference in the population means of the
experimental data for experts (or students) before and after using the ORLM tool.
• Alternative Hypothesis H1: There is a significant difference in the population means of the
experimental data for experts (or students) before and after using the ORLM tool.
Next, we conduct statistical tests separately for experts and students on both accuracy and time
efficiency data. Before performing hypothesis testing, we first examine the distributional properties
of the data to determine the most appropriate testing method. Specifically, we assess whether the
data follow a normal distribution and whether homogeneity of variance is satisfied.
To test for normality, we employ the Shapiro-Wilk test, as it is more sensitive for small sample
sizes (n ≤50) (Shapiro and Wilk 1965). Similarly, to assess the homogeneity of variance, we use the
Levene’s test, which is also suitable for small samples (Ott and Longnecker 2010). The results of
these tests are summarized in Table 16.

Table 16 presents Shapiro-Wilk and Levene test results for two outcome measures — accuracy
and time — across total, expert, and student samples comparing Group A and Group B.
While the expert and student subgroups show normality in time data for both groups (with
p-values above 0.05), the total sample reveals marginal normality in Group A (p = 0.045) and
significant heterogeneity of variance (p = 0.002). For accuracy, all samples (total, expert, and student)
exhibit severe non-normality in Group B (p ≤0.003), despite meeting variance homogeneity criteria
(p > 0.05). Consequently:
• Time: A Mann-Whitney U test is recommended for the total sample due to Group A’s marginal
normality and variance heterogeneity, though independent t -tests may still apply to expert/s-
tudent subgroups.
• Accuracy: A Mann-Whitney U test is used across all samples due to Group B’s consistent
non-normality.
We summarize the results in Table 17.
Table 17 presents key statistical metrics, including the statistic value (Stat), the p-value (p-value),
the 95% confidence level of the difference (Confidence Interval), the effect size (Hedge’s g), and the
statistical power (Stat Power).
In addition to standard hypothesis testing results, we have further computed the effect size
(Hedge’s g) and the statistical power to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the robustness
of our conclusions (Cohen 2013). Specifically, Hedge’s g is a standardized measure of mean difference
between two groups, which is an improved version of Cohen’s d designed for small sample sizes. It is
important to note that effect size is independent of sample size, making it a more objective indicator

of the generalizability of our findings, even for small samples. Statistical power (Stat Power), on the
other hand, represents the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis — i.e., detecting a
true effect when one exists. A high statistical power reduces the risk of Type II errors (failing to
detect a real effect).
As shown in Table 17, at a 95% confidence level, the use of ORLM significantly improves both
solution time and accuracy across all populations (total, expert, and student samples). The confidence
intervals suggest that, after implementing ORLM, accuracy improves by approximately 10%–25%.
Additionally, the total time saved in solving optimization modeling problems is 1.8-2.2 hours, with
experts saving approximately 1.5–2 hours and students saving around 2–2.5 hours. Additionally, the
absolute value of Hedge’s g values exceed 1, demonstrating a substantial effect size and indicating a
large difference between the experimental and control groups. Furthermore, the statistical power
values all exceed 0.8, which is considered a strong threshold, ensuring a high probability of detecting
a true effect and minimizing the risk of a Type II error.
In conclusion, our findings provide compelling evidence that ORLM significantly enhances both
accuracy and efficiency for both students and experts in solving operational research modeling
problems.
A.7. Examples of Questions with Different Difficulty Levels
A.7.1. Easy Example
A company sells custom scooters and bikes for customers. The profit per
scooter is $200 and the profit per bike is $300. Each product requires time with the design team and
engineering team. Each scooter needs 2 hours with the design team and 3 hours with the engineering
team. Each bike needs 4 hours with the design team and 5 hours with the engineering team. Per
month, there are 5000 hours available on the design team and 6000 hours available on the engineering
team. How many of each should the company make per month to maximize profit?
A.7.2. Medium Example
We consider the following employee scheduling problem: A company
needs to reassign 6 employees to complete the work over the next ten days. The daily workforce

requirements and the availability of each employee for reassignment are known. Let wj denote
the number of employees required on day j, and αij indicate whether employee i is available for
reassignment on day j. Furthermore, let I represent the set of all employees and J denote the set of
working days.
The objectives are twofold: (1) to ensure that each day’s workforce requirements are met as closely
as possible, minimizing the number of unfulfilled positions; and (2) to balance the distribution of
workdays among employees, minimizing disparities in their workloads.
A.7.3. Hard Example
The scheduling of hot coil transportation involves vehicle dispatch between
warehouses and between warehouses and docks. Transportation tasks between warehouses are called
transfer tasks, while those between warehouses and docks are called dock tasks.
Before the start of each shift, schedulers need to assign vehicles to the existing steel coil trans-
portation tasks, determine the execution time for each task, and ensure all tasks are assigned. Tasks
have merging rules: tasks with the same starting and ending points can be executed by the same
vehicle, but the total weight and the total number of steel coils must not exceed the vehicle’s limits.
Vehicles do not pick up new tasks while en route; they can only pick up a new task after completing
the current one.
Task Format: Steel coil ID, steel coil weight, starting warehouse, destination warehouse (dock),
ship ID, task priority
1. Minimize the number of vehicles used
2. Ensure that all tasks are completed as early as possible
3. Prioritize tasks with high priority
Constraints is listed as follows:
1. Vehicles have an initial parking spot and must start from this spot when executing the first
task of the shift
2. The number of steel coils loaded on a vehicle must not exceed the vehicle’s limit
3. The weight of steel coils loaded on a vehicle must not exceed the vehicle’s limit
4. The vehicle’s transportation speed must be within the maximum and minimum speed limits
5. Different ships at the same dock must be loaded sequentially; the next ship’s loading can only
start after the previous ship’s loading is completed
6. There is a limit to the number of vehicles simultaneously executing dock tasks
7. There is a limit to the number of vehicles simultaneously executing transfer tasks
8. The number of vehicles operating simultaneously in the warehouse area has an upper limit
9. No new tasks should be assigned to vehicles in the last half hour of the current shift
The sequence of tasks and estimated time nodes for all vehicles within this shift.
