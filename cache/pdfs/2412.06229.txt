Abstract—This paper introduces DebateBrawl, an innovative
AI-powered debate platform that integrates Large Language
Models (LLMs), Genetic Algorithms (GA), and Adversarial
Search (AS) to create an adaptive and engaging debating experi-
ence. DebateBrawl addresses the limitations of traditional LLMs
in strategic planning by incorporating evolutionary optimization
and game-theoretic techniques. The system demonstrates remark-
able performance in generating coherent, contextually relevant
arguments while adapting its strategy in real-time. Experimental
results involving 23 debates show balanced outcomes between
AI and human participants, with the AI system achieving an
average score of 2.72 compared to the human average of 2.67
out of 10. User feedback indicates significant improvements in
debating skills and a highly satisfactory learning experience,
with 85% of users reporting improved debating abilities and
78% finding the AI opponent appropriately challenging. The
system’s ability to maintain high factual accuracy (92% com-
pared to 78% in human-only debates) while generating diverse
arguments addresses critical concerns in AI-assisted discourse.
DebateBrawl not only serves as an effective educational tool but
also contributes to the broader goal of improving public discourse
through AI-assisted argumentation. The paper discusses the
ethical implications of AI in persuasive contexts and outlines
the measures implemented to ensure responsible development
and deployment of the system, including robust fact-checking
mechanisms and transparency in decision-making processes.

I. INTRODUCTION
The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and argu-
mentation has emerged as a new platform, promising to
reform debates, improve critical thinking, and foster more
informed discourse. As language models become increasingly
sophisticated, their potential as intelligent debate partners
and argumentation assistants has captured the imagination of
researchers and educators. This paper introduces DebateBrawl,
a novel system that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs),
Genetic Algorithms (GA), and Adversarial Search (AS) to
create an adaptive and engaging debate platform.
However, current AI-powered debate systems face several
critical challenges that limit their effectiveness as educational
and practice tools. First, while LLMs excel at generating fluent
responses, they lack strategic depth in extended debates, often
failing to maintain consistent argumentation strategies across
multiple exchanges. Second, existing systems typically operate
with fixed response patterns, unable to adapt to different
debate styles or learn from past interactions. Third, most
platforms lack sophisticated planning capabilities needed to
anticipate and effectively counter opponent arguments. These
limitations result in debate experiences that, while techno-
logically advanced, fail to provide the dynamic, adaptive,
and educational interaction necessary for meaningful debate
practice. DebateBrawl addresses these fundamental challenges
through a novel integration of three complementary technolo-
gies: LLMs for natural language understanding and generation,
Genetic Algorithms for strategic evolution and adaptation,
and Adversarial Search for predictive planning and counter-
argument generation.
The development of transformer-based language models,
based on GPT architectures, has marked a paradigm shift
in natural language processing [1]. These models, trained on
vast corpora of text, have demonstrated remarkable capabili-
ties in generating coherent, context-aware text across diverse
domains. However, while LLMs excel at generating fluent and
contextually relevant responses, they often lack the strategic
depth and adaptability required for nuanced, multi-turn de-
bates. This limitation stems from their fundamentally reactive
nature, where responses are generated based on immediate
context rather than long-term strategic planning [2].
DebateBrawl addresses this challenge by incorporating ge-
netic algorithms and adversarial search techniques. Genetic
algorithms, inspired by natural selection and evolution, have
proven effective in optimizing complex, multi-dimensional
problems [3]. In the context of debate, GAs evolve and refine
argumentation strategies over time, adapting to the specific
topic, opponent, and flow of the debate. This evolutionary
approach allows the system to discover and hone effective
combinations of rhetorical devices, logical structures, and
persuasive techniques.
Adversarial search provides a framework for anticipating

and planning responses to potential counterarguments [4]. By
simulating possible debate trajectories and evaluating their
outcomes, AS enables the system to make more informed
decisions about argument selection and presentation. In De-
bateBrawl, this is made possible through a debate move
predictor that anticipates opponent strategies and suggests
effective counter-moves. The synergy between GAs and AS
creates a debate engine that can not only generate coherent
arguments but also strategically plan its approach to maximize
persuasiveness and effectiveness.
The integration of LLMs, GAs, and AS in DebateBrawl
represents a significant advancement in AI-assisted argumen-
tation systems. Previous work in this field has primarily
focused on argument mining [5], stance detection [6], and
automated fact-checking [7]. While these approaches have
made valuable contributions to computational argumentation,
they often operate on a more granular level, focusing on
individual arguments or claims rather than the holistic process
of debate. DebateBrawl builds upon these foundations but
takes a more comprehensive approach, addressing the full
lifecycle of a debate from argument generation to strategic
planning and adaptive response.
The development of DebateBrawl is motivated by the grow-
ing recognition of the importance of critical thinking and
argumentation skills in education and public discourse. In an
era characterized by information overload and rapid spread of
misinformation, the ability to construct, analyze, and evaluate
arguments is more crucial than ever [8]. Traditional debate
training methods, while valuable, are often limited by resource
constraints and the availability of skilled human opponents and
coaches.
II. RELATED WORKS
The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with
evolutionary algorithms and other optimization techniques has
proved to be a promising area of research, offering new possi-
bilities for improving AI systems’ capabilities across various
domains. This section explores the diverse applications and
methodologies that combine LLMs with evolutionary compu-
tation, genetic algorithms, and other optimization strategies.
A. Evolutionary Algorithms and LLMs
The synergy between evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and
LLMs has been explored in several studies, showcasing the
potential for improved optimization and problem-solving ca-
pabilities. Liu et al. [9] introduced LLM-driven Evolutionary
Algorithms (LMEA), a novel approach that uses LLMs as evo-
lutionary combinatorial optimizers. Their work demonstrates
that LLMs can be effectively used to select parent solutions,
perform crossover and mutation operations, and generate off-
spring solutions with minimal domain knowledge and human
intervention. The authors applied LMEA to classical traveling
salesman problems (TSPs), showing competitive performance
compared to traditional heuristics for instances with up to 20
nodes.
In a related study, Chao et al. [10] explored the parallels
between LLMs and EAs, identifying common characteristics
such as token representation and individual representation,
position encoding and fitness shaping, and model training and
parameter adaptation. The authors analyzed existing interdis-
ciplinary research, focusing on evolutionary fine-tuning and
LLM-enhanced EAs.
B. LLMs in Game Design and Creative Tasks
The application of LLMs in creative tasks, such as game
design, has also been explored. Lanzi and Loiacono [11] pre-
sented a collaborative game design framework that combines
interactive evolution and LLMs to simulate the human design
process. Their approach uses an interactive genetic algorithm
to exploit user feedback for selecting promising ideas, while
LLMs are employed for the complex creative task of re-
combining and varying ideas. This framework demonstrates
the potential of LLMs in augmenting human creativity and
facilitating collaborative design processes.
C. LLMs in Decision-Making and Planning
Several studies have investigated the use of LLMs in
decision-making and planning tasks. Zhou et al. [12] intro-
duced Language Agent Tree Search (LATS), a framework that
integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search with LLMs to enable
more effective reasoning, acting, and planning. LATS uses
the in-context learning ability of LLMs and incorporates LM-
powered value functions and self-reflections for proficient
exploration and improved decision-making. The framework
demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in various domains,
including programming, interactive question-answering, web
navigation, and math problems.
Similarly, Wan et al. [13] proposed an AlphaZero-like tree-
search learning framework for LLMs (TS-LLM), which uses a
learned value function to guide LLM decoding. Their approach
is adaptable to a wide range of tasks, language models of
various sizes, and tasks with varying search depths. TS-LLM
showed improved performance in reasoning, planning, align-
ment, and decision-making tasks, demonstrating the potential
of combining tree search algorithms with LLMs for improved
problem-solving capabilities.
D. LLMs in Recommender Systems
The integration of LLMs into recommender systems has
been explored to improve user interaction and personaliza-
tion. Friedman et al. [14] proposed a roadmap for building
large-scale conversational recommender systems using LLMs.
Their work addresses challenges in understanding user pref-
erences and dialogue management by introducing RecLLM,
a YouTube video-based conversational recommender system
that facilitates natural conversations and personalized recom-
mendations.
E. LLMs in Neural Architecture Search and Model Optimiza-
tion
The application of LLMs and evolutionary techniques in
optimizing neural network architectures has been an area


--- Page 3 ---
of active research. Sarah et al. [15] proposed an effective
method for finding Pareto-optimal network architectures based
on LLaMA2-7B using one-shot Neural Architecture Search
(NAS). Their approach combines fine-tuning with genetic
algorithm-based search to identify smaller, less computation-
ally complex network architectures. The study demonstrated
significant reductions in model size and improvements in
throughput for certain tasks, with minimal accuracy loss.
Zhong et al. [16] introduced a novel LLM-assisted opti-
mizer (LLMO) for addressing adversarial robustness in neural
architecture search (ARNAS). Their approach uses the Gemini
LLM to generate solutions for ARNAS instances, demonstrat-
ing competitive performance compared to well-known meta-
heuristic algorithms. This research highlights the potential of
LLMs as effective combinatorial optimizers in the context of
neural architecture design and optimization.
F. LLMs in Molecular Design and Materials Science
The application of generative models, including LLMs, in
drug discovery and materials science has shown promise in
overcoming limitations of traditional inverse design methods.
Bhowmik et al. [17] examined the effectiveness of generative
models in creating virtual libraries of molecules and facilitat-
ing drug discovery. The authors proposed a hybrid architecture
combining masked language models with generative adversar-
ial networks (GANs) to efficiently generate new molecules.
G. Explainable AI and LLMs in Genetic Programming
The integration of explainable AI (XAI) techniques with
genetic programming and LLMs has been explored to im-
prove the interpretability of complex algorithms. Maddigan
et al. [18] introduced GP4NLDR, an XAI dashboard that
combines genetic programming with an LLM-powered chatbot
to provide comprehensive, user-centered explanations for non-
linear dimensionality reduction. Their study demonstrates the
potential of using LLMs to generate intuitive and insightful
narratives about high-dimensional data reduction processes,
while also addressing important considerations such as data
privacy and the challenges of hallucinatory outputs from
LLMs.
H. LLMs in Artificial Evolutionary Intelligence
The concept of Artificial Evolutionary Intelligence (AEI),
which combines evolutionary computation with artificial gen-
eral intelligence, has been proposed as a promising direction
for future research. He et al. [19] discussed a paradigm of
LLMs for evolutionary computation, addressing three main
issues: multi-modal representation capability, general models
for versatile learning, and the ability to understand evolution-
ary computation concepts and behaviors.
I. Challenges and Ethical Considerations
While the integration of LLMs with evolutionary and
optimization techniques shows great promise, it also raises
important challenges and ethical considerations. Gaudi [20]
conducted a comprehensive survey on adversarial aspects in
LLMs, discussing issues such as harmful generation, fairness,
privacy, and robustness. The study highlights the need for
adversarial training techniques, fine-tuning methods, and mit-
igation strategies to address these challenges.
Zhang et al. [21] provided a comprehensive study on knowl-
edge editing for LLMs, proposing a unified categorization
criterion for knowledge editing methods. Their work intro-
duces a new benchmark, KnowEdit, for evaluating knowledge
editing approaches and discusses potential applications and
implications of this technology. This research underscores
the importance of developing methods to efficiently modify
LLMs’ behaviors within specific domains while preserving
overall performance across various inputs.
The integration of LLMs with evolutionary algorithms and
optimization techniques represents a rapidly evolving and
promising field of research. From healthcare applications to
game design, from molecular modeling to neural architecture
search, LLMs are being combined with various computa-
tional techniques to improve problem-solving capabilities, im-
prove decision-making processes, and generate novel solutions
across diverse domains. As this field continues to develop,
addressing ethical considerations, improving explainability,
and optimizing performance on resource-constrained hardware
will be crucial areas of focus for future research.
III. METHODOLOGY
The DebateBrawl system represents an innovative approach
to AI-powered debate platforms, integrating advanced natural
language processing techniques with adaptive learning algo-
rithms. This section provides a detailed overview of the system
architecture, key components, and methodologies employed in
the development and implementation of DebateBrawl.
A. System Architecture
DebateBrawl employs a client-server architecture, designed
for modularity, scalability, and efficiency. Figure 1 illustrates
the overall system architecture.
Fig. 1. Overall System Architecture of DebateBrawl


--- Page 4 ---
The system is divided into frontend and backend compo-
nents, connected through well-defined APIs. This separation
allows for independent development and scaling of each
component. The architecture is designed to handle multiple
concurrent debates while maintaining low latency and high
throughput, crucial for a responsive and engaging user expe-
rience.
1) Frontend Architecture: The frontend of DebateBrawl is
built using Next.js, a React-based framework that provides
server-side rendering capabilities and optimized performance.
Figure 2 details the frontend architecture.
Fig. 2. Frontend Architecture of DebateBrawl
Key components of the frontend include:

including profile management, debate history tracking,
and performance analytics.
The frontend provides an intuitive and engaging user in-
terface, allowing users to participate in debates, view AI-
generated arguments, and receive real-time feedback on their
performance. The use of server-side rendering ensures fast ini-
tial page loads and improved SEO, while client-side navigation
provides a smooth, app-like experience during debates.
2) Backend Architecture: The backend of DebateBrawl
is powered by FastAPI, a modern, high-performance web
framework for building APIs with Python. Figure 3 illustrates
the backend architecture.
Fig. 3. Backend Architecture of DebateBrawl
Key components of the backend include:
• FastAPI: Serves as the main API server, handling re-
quests from the frontend and coordinating backend ser-
vices. FastAPI’s asynchronous capabilities allow for effi-
cient handling of concurrent requests.
• Firebase Admin SDK: Used for server-side authenti-
cation and access to the Firestore database. This SDK
provides secure methods for verifying user tokens and
performing database operations.
• Debate Manager: Orchestrates the debate process, in-
cluding argument generation, evaluation, and scoring.
This central component coordinates the activities of other
AI modules and maintains the overall state of each debate.
• User Management: Handles user-related operations and
data storage, synchronizing with the frontend user man-
agement module to ensure data consistency.
• GA Strategy Evolver: Implements the Genetic Algo-
rithm for evolving debate strategies. This module contin-
uously optimizes AI debate tactics based on performance
data.
• AS Move Predictor: Implements the Adversarial Search
for predicting opponent moves. By anticipating likely
user arguments, this module enables the AI to prepare
more effective responses.
• LLM Interface: Provides a unified interface for interact-
ing with multiple language models. This abstraction layer


--- Page 5 ---
allows for easy integration of different LLMs and simpli-
fies the process of generating and evaluating arguments.
The backend architecture is designed to handle multiple
concurrent debates while maintaining low latency and high
throughput. The use of asynchronous programming patterns
and efficient database access ensures that the system can scale
to accommodate a growing user base.
B. Large Language Models (LLMs)
DebateBrawl uses multiple LLMs to generate diverse and
contextually relevant responses. The system integrates three
main models:
• LLaMA Model: Used for generating debate topics,
arguments, and evaluating argument quality. LLaMA’s
broad knowledge base makes it particularly suitable for
generating diverse and informative content across various
debate topics.
• Gemma Model: Specialized in generating AI opponent
responses. Gemma’s architecture is optimized for main-
taining coherence in extended exchanges, making it ideal
for simulating a consistent debate opponent.
• Phi Model: Focused on providing debate assistant re-
sponses and feedback. Phi’s design emphasizes clarity
and educational value, making it well-suited for generat-
ing constructive feedback and explanations.
Figure 4 illustrates the LLM Interface and its interactions
with the various models and functionalities.
Fig. 4. LLM Interface and Model Interactions
The LLM Interface serves as an abstraction layer, allowing
seamless integration and interaction with these models. This
multi-model approach enables the system to use the strengths
of each model for specific tasks, improving the overall quality
and diversity of generated content. The interface includes so-
phisticated prompt engineering techniques to guide the models
towards generating high-quality, task-specific outputs.
C. Genetic Algorithm (GA) for Strategy Evolution
The GA Strategy Evolver is a crucial component that adapts
and optimizes debate strategies over time. Figure 5 illustrates
the GA process flow.
Fig. 5. Genetic Algorithm Process Flow
The GA implementation follows these key steps:
1) Initialization: Create an initial population of debate
strategies, each represented as a combination of rhetor-
ical elements (ethos, pathos, logos). The initial pop-
ulation is generated with random variations to ensure
diversity.
2) Fitness Evaluation: Assess the performance of each
strategy based on debate outcomes and argument ef-
fectiveness. Fitness metrics include factors such as ar-
gument persuasiveness, logical consistency, and overall
debate success rate.
3) Selection: Choose the fittest strategies for reproduction
using techniques such as tournament selection or roulette
wheel selection. This process ensures that successful
strategies have a higher chance of passing on their
characteristics.
4) Crossover: Combine selected strategies to create new
offspring strategies. Various crossover techniques are
employed, including single-point, two-point, and uni-
form crossover, to generate diverse offspring.
5) Mutation: Introduce random variations to maintain ge-
netic diversity. Mutation helps prevent the population
from converging prematurely on suboptimal solutions
and allows for the exploration of novel debate tactics.
6) Replacement: Update the population with the new
generation of strategies, potentially keeping some elite
individuals from the previous generation to preserve
successful traits.
The GA continuously evolves strategies, learning from past
debates and adapting to different topics and opponents. This
adaptive approach ensures that the AI debater’s arguments
become more effective and persuasive over time.


--- Page 6 ---
D. Adversarial Search (AS) for Move Prediction
The AS Move Predictor uses game theory principles to
anticipate opponent moves and plan counter-arguments. Figure
6 illustrates the AS process flow.
Fig. 6. Adversarial Search Process Flow
The AS implementation involves:
1) State Representation: Model the current debate state,
including past arguments, topic context, and relevant
metadata. This comprehensive state representation cap-
tures key aspects of the debate, such as argument
strength, topic coverage, and emotional impact.
2) Move Generation: Generate possible next moves or
arguments for both the AI and the opponent. This
process uses the LLM models to create a diverse set of
potential arguments based on the current debate state.
3) Evaluation Function: Assess the strength and potential
impact of each possible move. The evaluation function
combines heuristics derived from debate theory with
machine learning models trained on historical debate
data.
4) Search Algorithm: Implement a minimax or Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to explore the
game tree and select the best move. The search depth is
dynamically adjusted based on computational constraints
and the desired level of foresight.
By predicting likely opponent arguments, the system can
proactively prepare more effective counter-arguments and
maintain a strategic advantage throughout the debate. The AS
component works in tandem with the GA-evolved strategies
to create a formidable and adaptive AI opponent.
E. Debate Flow and Argument Generation
The debate process in DebateBrawl follows a structured
flow, designed to create an engaging and educational expe-
rience for users. The key steps include:
1) Topic Selection: Users choose from pre-generated de-
bate topics or request a new topic generated by the
LLaMA model. The topic generation process ensures
a diverse range of subjects, balancing current events,
historical topics, and hypothetical scenarios.
2) Position Assignment: Users select their position (for
or against) on the chosen topic. This allows users to
practice arguing from different perspectives, improving
their critical thinking skills.
3) Argument Submission: Users and the AI take turns
submitting arguments. Each turn is limited to a specific
time frame to maintain engagement and simulate the
pressure of real-time debates.
4) Argument Evaluation: Each argument is evaluated
based on relevance, persuasiveness, and logical consis-
tency using a combination of LLM-based analysis and
pre-defined rubrics.
5) Strategy Adaptation: The GA evolves strategies based
on the effectiveness of arguments and overall debate
performance.
6) Move Prediction: The AS predicts the opponent’s next
move to inform the AI’s response, creating more dy-
namic and realistic exchanges.
7) Feedback Generation: The system provides real-time
feedback and suggestions to users for improving their
arguments, fostering learning and skill development.
Figure 7 illustrates the detailed sequence of interactions be-
tween the user, frontend, backend, and various AI components
during a debate session.
Fig. 7. Debate Flow Sequence Diagram
The debate flow sequence proceeds as follows:
1) The user initiates a debate through the frontend interface.
2) The frontend sends a POST request to the backend to
start the debate.
3) The backend initializes the debate, including setting up
the GA Strategy Evolver and AS Move Predictor.


--- Page 7 ---
4) The backend returns a debate ID to the frontend, which
then displays the debate UI to the user.
5) The debate enters a loop of rounds, where:
• The user submits an argument through the frontend.
• The frontend sends the argument to the backend.
• The backend generates an AI response using the
LLM Interface.
• The GA Strategy Evolver updates its strategies
based on the debate progress.
• The AS Move Predictor anticipates the next user
move.
• The backend sends the AI response, feedback, and
scores back to the frontend.
• The frontend displays the AI response and feedback
to the user.
6) Once the debate concludes, the frontend requests the
final debate state from the backend.
7) The backend returns the final state, which the frontend
uses to display the debate results to the user.
The argument generation process uses the LLM Interface
to create coherent, contextually relevant, and persuasive argu-
ments. The system considers the current debate state, evolved
strategies from the GA, and predictions from the AS to
generate optimal responses.
F. Evaluation and Feedback Mechanism
DebateBrawl implements a comprehensive evaluation and
feedback system to assess argument quality and provide con-
structive feedback to users. The evaluation process considers
multiple factors:
• Relevance: How well the argument addresses the debate
topic and responds to previous points. This involves
semantic analysis to determine the alignment between the
argument’s content and the overall debate context.
• Persuasiveness: The strength and impact of the argument
in supporting the debater’s position. This includes analyz-
ing the use of rhetorical devices and the emotional appeal
of the language used.
• Logical Consistency: The coherence and validity of the
reasoning presented. This involves identifying logical
fallacies and assessing the strength of causal relationships
presented in the argument.
• Evidence Usage: The effective incorporation of facts,
examples, or expert opinions to support claims. This
includes verifying the credibility of sources cited and the
relevance of the evidence to the argument.
The evaluation feedback is generated using a combination
of LLM-based analysis and pre-defined rubrics. This feedback
helps users understand the strengths and weaknesses of their
arguments, promoting learning and skill development.
G. Data Management and Security
DebateBrawl prioritizes data security and efficient manage-
ment through the use of Firebase for user authentication and
Firestore for data storage. Key considerations include:
• Secure authentication flows using Firebase Auth, support-
ing multiple authentication methods.
• Role-based access control for different user types, ensur-
ing that users only have access to appropriate data and
functionalities.
• Encrypted storage of sensitive user information and de-
bate content, both in transit and at rest.
• Efficient indexing and querying of debate data for per-
formance optimization, ensuring fast retrieval of relevant
information.
The system also implements comprehensive logging and
monitoring to track system performance, detect anomalies, and
ensure compliance with data protection regulations.
In conclusion, the methodology behind DebateBrawl repre-
sents a comprehensive and innovative approach to AI-assisted
debate platforms. By integrating advanced language models
with adaptive learning algorithms and game theory principles,
and focusing on user engagement and skill development,
DebateBrawl aims to provide a unique and valuable tool for
improving critical thinking and argumentation skills
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
To evaluate the effectiveness of the DebateBrawl system,
which integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Ge-
netic Algorithms (GA) and Adversarial Search (AS) for adap-
tive debate arguments, we conducted a series of experiments.
These experiments were designed to assess the system’s per-
formance, compare it with baseline approaches, analyze the
evolution of debate strategies, and gather user feedback.
A. Performance Metrics of the Integrated System
The DebateBrawl system’s performance was evaluated
across multiple debates on various topics. We analyzed the
outcomes of 23 debates, involving both the AI system and
human participants. The primary metrics used for evaluation
were the scores assigned to the AI and human debaters,
reflecting the quality and persuasiveness of their arguments.
Fig. 8. AI vs User Performance in Debates


--- Page 8 ---
Fig. 8 illustrates the distribution of AI versus User scores
across all debates. The scatter plot reveals a generally positive
correlation between AI and User scores, indicating that the
system adapts its performance to match or slightly exceed that
of the human participant. This adaptability is a key feature of
the DebateBrawl system, made possible by the integration of
GA and AS with the LLM.
Further analysis of the performance metrics reveals interest-
ing insights into the system’s capabilities. The average scores
for both AI and human participants were calculated across all
debates:
• Average AI Score: 2.72 (out of a possible 10)
• Average User Score: 2.67 (out of a possible 10)
These scores indicate that, on average, the AI system
performed slightly better than human participants, although
the difference is minimal. This close performance suggests
that the DebateBrawl system can provide a challenging and
engaging debate experience for users, potentially serving as
an effective tool for improving argumentation skills.
B. Comparison with Baseline Systems
To contextualize the performance of the DebateBrawl sys-
tem, we compared it with two baseline approaches: an LLM-
only system and human-only debates.
1) Comparison with LLM-only System: A series of debates
were conducted using an LLM-only system, which lacked the
adaptive capabilities provided by the GA and AS components.
The results showed that the DebateBrawl system outperformed
the LLM-only approach in several key areas:

Table I summarizes the performance comparison between
the DebateBrawl system and the LLM-only system. The
DebateBrawl system demonstrated better performance in ar-
gument coherence, strategic adaptation, and overall persua-
siveness, highlighting the value added by the GA and AS
components.
2) Comparison with Human-only Debates: We also com-
pared the DebateBrawl-mediated debates with traditional
human-only debates on similar topics. A group of 5 human
participants engaged in debates without AI assistance, and
their performances were evaluated using the same criteria
applied to the DebateBrawl system.
Table II presents a comparative analysis of DebateBrawl-
mediated debates versus human-only debates. The Debate-
Brawl system demonstrated advantages in argument diversity,
factual accuracy, and debate pace. Additionally, participants
reported a higher learning rate in DebateBrawl-mediated de-
bates.

C. Analysis of Strategy Evolution over Multiple Debates
One of the key features of the DebateBrawl system is its
ability to evolve debate strategies using Genetic Algorithms.
We analyzed the evolution of these strategies across multiple
debates to understand how the system adapts and improves its
performance over time.
Fig. 9 illustrates the effectiveness of different GA-evolved
strategies in terms of average user scores. The data reveals
several interesting trends:
1) Emphasis on Pathos: The most successful strategies tend
to place a greater emphasis on pathos (emotional appeal)
compared to ethos (credibility) and logos (logical rea-
soning).
2) Balanced Approach: While pathos is dominant, the top-
performing strategies maintain a balance between all
three elements of persuasion.
3) Adaptability: The variety of successful strategies demon-
strates the system’s ability to adapt to different debate
topics and opponents.
4) Evolution Over Time: Analysis of strategy evolution
across consecutive debates showed a general trend to-
wards more refined and effective strategies.
These findings highlight the DebateBrawl system’s ability to
tailor its approach based on the subject matter and opponent,
a crucial skill in effective debating.
D. User Feedback and Experience Analysis
To gain insights into the user experience and perceived
effectiveness of the DebateBrawl system, we conducted sur-
veys and interviews with participants after their engagement
with the platform. A total of 10 users provided feedback,
ranging from novice debaters to experienced argumentation
enthusiasts.

Qualitative feedback further supported these findings, with
users highlighting the system’s ability to challenge their criti-
cal thinking, adapt to their debating style, and provide valuable
learning experiences for debaters of all skill levels.
E. User Interface and Interaction
To provide a comprehensive view of the DebateBrawl
system’s functionality and user experience, we present key
screenshots from the application interface.
1) Debate Interface: Figure 10 shows the main debate
interface of DebateBrawl.
This interface displays the current debate topic, round
information, and areas for user input and AI responses. The
right panel provides AI-generated suggestions to assist the user
in formulating their arguments.
2) AI Argument Generation: Figure 11 demonstrates an
example of an AI-generated argument in the DebateBrawl
system.
This sample shows how the AI constructs a coherent and
structured argument, addressing multiple aspects of the debate
topic.
3) Evaluation Feedback: Figure 12 illustrates the evalua-
tion feedback provided by the system.
The feedback covers various aspects of the argument,
including strength, relevance, and persuasiveness, providing
users with constructive criticism to improve their debating
skills.
4) GA and AS Integration: Figure 13 shows how the
Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Adversarial Search (AS) com-
ponents are integrated into the debate process.
This interface demonstrates how the GA suggests debate
strategies and the AS predicts the next move, improving the
AI’s adaptability and strategic thinking.
These interface elements collectively demonstrate the com-
prehensive and user-friendly nature of the DebateBrawl sys-
tem, highlighting its potential as an effective tool for debate
practice and skill development.
The experimental results demonstrate the DebateBrawl sys-
tem’s effectiveness in generating adaptive and persuasive de-
bate arguments. The integration of LLMs with Genetic Algo-
rithms and Adversarial Search has resulted in a system that can
engage in competitive debates with human participants, adapt
its strategies effectively, and provide a valuable platform for
improving argumentation skills.
V. CONCLUSION
The DebateBrawl system opens up numerous pathway for
future research and development in AI-assisted argumenta-
tion and education. The modular architecture of the system,
particularly the abstraction layer provided by the LLM In-
terface, allows for easy integration of new language mod-
els and computational techniques as they emerge, making
sure that DebateBrawl can evolve alongside advancements
in AI technology. Future work could explore the integration
of multimodal inputs and outputs, enabling the system to

engage with visual and auditory elements of argumentation,
thereby creating a more comprehensive debate experience.
Additionally, the potential for personalized learning pathways,
dynamically adjusted based on individual user progress and
learning styles, presents an new direction for improving the
system’s educational impact. As we continue to refine and
expand upon this work, addressing current limitations such
as contextual understanding in extended debates and further
improving the system’s ethical reasoning capabilities will be
crucial. The ethical considerations raised by AI-generated
persuasive content also warrant ongoing attention and research,
particularly in developing robust safeguards against potential
misuse while maintaining the system’s effectiveness as a learn-
ing tool. Furthermore, the application of DebateBrawl’s under-
lying technologies to other domains requiring strategic think-
ing and adaptive response generation—such as negotiation
training, policy analysis, or creative problem-solving—could
yield valuable insights and practical applications beyond the
domain of formal debate.
Ultimately, the DebateBrawl system not only serves as a
powerful tool for improving individual argumentation skills
but also contributes to the broader goal of providing more
informed, nuanced, and constructive public discourse in an
era of complex global challenges. By democratizing access
to high-quality debate practice and feedback, DebateBrawl
has the potential to empower a wider range of voices in
important discussions, potentially leading to more diverse and
well-reasoned approaches to problem-solving across various
fields. As we move forward, the continued development and
responsible deployment of AI-assisted argumentation systems
like DebateBrawl will play a crucial role in shaping the future
of education, public discourse, and collaborative decision-
making processes.
