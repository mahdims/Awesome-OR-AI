Abstract
The emergence of 6G-enabled vehicular metaverses enables Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) to operate across physical and virtual
spaces through space–air–ground–sea integrated networks. The AVs can deploy Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents powered by large AI
models as personalized assistants, on edge servers to support intelligent driving decision making and enhanced on-board experiences.
However, such cross-reality interactions may cause serious location privacy risks, as adversaries can infer AV trajectories by correlating
the location reported when AVs request Location-Based Services (LBS) in reality with the location of the edge servers on which their
corresponding AI agents are deployed in virtuality.
To address this challenge, we design a cross-reality location privacy protection
framework based on hybrid actions, including continuous location perturbation in reality and discrete privacy-aware AI agent migration
in virtuality.
In this framework, a new privacy metric, termed cross-reality location entropy, is proposed to effectively quantify the
privacy levels of AVs. Based on this metric, we formulate an optimization problem to optimize the hybrid action, focusing on achieving
a balance between location protection, service latency reduction, and quality of service maintenance. To solve the complex mixed-integer
problem, we develop a novel LLM-enhanced Hybrid Diffusion Proximal Policy Optimization (LHDPPO) algorithm, which integrates
Large Language Model (LLM)-driven informative reward design to enhance environment understanding with double Generative Diffusion
Models (GDMs)-based policy exploration to handle high-dimensional action spaces, thereby enabling reliable determination of optimal
hybrid actions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively mitigates cross-reality
location privacy leakage for AVs while maintaining strong user immersion within 6G-enabled vehicular metaverse scenarios.

LLM-enhanced Hybrid Generative Diffusion Model-based Approach. Sci China Inf Sci, for review

Introduction
The vehicular metaverse is a mobility metaverse paradigm blending of reality and virtuality, which is tailored
to enhance intelligence and interactivity in vehicular networks [1, 2]. With the advancement of sixth-generation
(6G) cellular technology, 6G-enabled vehicular metaverses have emerged to provide ultra-reliable and low-latency
connectivity across space–air–ground–sea integrated networks, enabling uninterrupted and high-quality services for
on-board users [3]. In this paradigm, due to the limited computing and storage resources of Autonomous Vehicles
(AVs), AVs typically deploy Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents powered by large AI models as their personalized
assistants on edge servers, where these edge servers can be terrestrial Roadside Units (RSUs) or Low-Earth Orbit
(LEO) satellite nodes [4, 5]. By hosting AI agents and executing computation-intensive tasks, these edge servers
enable resource-constrained AVs to access large AI model-based services, thereby enhancing driving safety and on-
board immersive experience. In this way, AVs exhibit agentic AI characteristics by leveraging perception, reasoning,
execution, and continuous learning capabilities to interact with physical and virtual spaces in an iterative and
context-aware manner [6].
Although the 6G-enabled vehicular metaverse empowered by agentic AI enables immersive services and intelligent
decision making across physical and virtual spaces, privacy risks become more prominent in such tightly coupled
cross-reality systems than traditional vehicular networks [7,8]. Specifically, the immersion of on-board users within

the vehicular metaverse is highly correlated to two key factors, i.e., reported location precision and service response
latency [9]. On the one hand, agentic AI-driven AVs in the physical space often request Location-Based Services
(LBS) frequently, such as Augmented Reality (AR) navigation and AR interactive games, where higher reported
location precision ensures better Quality of Service (QoS) but also incurs a higher risk of location privacy leakage [10].
On the other hand, due to the continuous mobility of AVs, their corresponding AI agents in the virtual space are
frequently migrated among edge servers in alignment with physical vehicle movements to maintain physical–virtual
synchronization and low-latency service provisioning, which further amplifies privacy risks [2, 11]. Consequently,
collusive adversaries can exploit their prior knowledge of AV routine mobility patterns, such as regular commuting
routes, to launch inference attacks that jointly reconstruct vehicle trajectories and AI agent migration patterns,
thereby accurately tracking target AVs [12]. This cross-reality linkage attack is more severe and harder to mitigate
than traditional single-domain privacy attacks, posing substantial threats to the location privacy of on-board users.
Existing research on cross-reality location privacy preservation in vehicular metaverses has primarily focused
on anonymity-based schemes [5, 9], which aim to obscure the linkage between vehicle identities and locations.
However, these approaches often suffer from significant performance degradation in low-traffic environments and
fail to meet the stringent privacy requirements of AVs [13]. These limitations highlight the need for a general
solution capable of protecting cross-reality location privacy in 6G-enabled vehicular metaverses. Moreover, most
existing location privacy metrics consider only a single dimension, typically confined to the physical space, and
therefore cannot accurately capture privacy leakage risks arising from cross-reality interactions. Consequently, a
more comprehensive metric is required to effectively evaluate location privacy under cross-reality inference attacks.
Furthermore, strengthening privacy protection at a large scale inevitably increases service response latency and
degrades QoS, thereby significantly diminishing user immersion in metaverse environments. As a result, achieving an
effective balance among cross-reality location privacy protection, latency reduction, and QoS maintenance remains
a challenging and open research problem.
To address the above challenges, this paper proposes a user-centric cross-reality location privacy protection
framework based on hybrid action decisions, including the continuous location perturbation in reality and discrete
privacy-aware AI agent migration in virtuality. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows.
• We present a cross-reality location privacy protection framework for 6G-enabled vehicular metaverses to
mitigate privacy leakage risk caused by spatiotemporal correlations between physical and virtual spaces.
The
framework integrates a hybrid action mechanism that combines continuous location perturbation in reality with
discrete privacy-aware AI agent migration in virtuality to preserve the location privacy of agentic AI-driven AVs.
• In the proposed framework, a new privacy metric named cross-reality location entropy is designed to quantify
the real-time location privacy levels of AVs under cross-reality inference attacks. The metric is derived from a
multi-condition Bayesian posterior distribution and captures the uncertainty of actual vehicle locations introduced
by hybrid action strategies. Based on this metric, a mixed-integer optimization problem that jointly considers cross-
reality location privacy, service response latency, and QoS loss to optimize hybrid action mechanisms is formulated.
• To solve the formulated complex problem in vehicular metaverse environments, we propose a novel LLM-
enhanced Hybrid Diffusion Proximal Policy Optimization (LHDPPO) algorithm, which incorporates Large Lan-
guage Model (LLM)-driven informative reward design for enhanced environment understanding and Generative
Diffusion Model (GDM)-based policy exploration for improved learning performance in high-dimensional action
spaces.
• Extensive experiments using real-world taxi mobility and base station datasets demonstrate that the proposed
framework achieves superior performance in terms of cross-reality location privacy preservation, immersive services
response latency reduction, and QoS maintenance when compared with existing baseline schemes.

Location Privacy Protection in Cross-reality Systems
Location privacy protection has become an active research topic in cross-reality systems, where existing solu-
tions are generally classified into encryption-based, anonymization-based, and obfuscation-based schemes [14]. For
encryption-based approaches, Liu et al. [15] proposed BlockSC, a blockchain-empowered spatial crowdsourcing
framework that preserves location privacy in metaverses through spatial data encryption. Although effective in se-
curing sensitive information, the heavy computational overhead of cryptographic operations limits its suitability for
real-time services in 6G-enabled vehicular metaverses. Anonymization-based schemes aim to weaken the association
between users and their trajectories by concealing real identities. For instance, Luo et al. [12] developed a dual

pseudonym change scheme to achieve identity anonymization in vehicular metaverses, but its effectiveness degrades
in sparse traffic areas, and it cannot fully realize location concealment. Obfuscation-based schemes protect privacy
by perturbing reported positions to reduce adversarial inference accuracy. For instance, Wang et al. [16] proposed
a perturbed sliding task queue algorithm based on differential privacy to protect sensitive user location information
prior to task offloading in a digital twin architecture, yet it considers only physical space location perturbation and
neglects interactions in the virtual space. Therefore, there is still a lack of practical solutions that are capable of
preserving cross-reality location privacy in 6G-enabled vehicular metaverses.
2.2
Location Privacy Metrics
Location privacy metrics provide quantitative tools for evaluating protection schemes in mobile networks. Emara
et al. [17] showed that widely used metrics in VANETs, such as anonymity set size, entropy, and adversary success
rate, each capture only a partial aspect of privacy and may yield inconsistent evaluations across scenarios. Li et
al. [18] proposed distance and visibility-based metrics for navigation services, but the metrics remain confined to
physical trajectories and ignore virtual space privacy leakage. To model inference from service migration, an entropy-
based metric proposed in [11] quantifies location uncertainty under MEC service placement, although it considers
only location exposure during service migration and neglects sensitive broadcast information in the physical space.
More recently, Kang et al. [5] introduced the Degree of Privacy Entropy (DoPE) to assess pseudonym changes in
vehicular edge metaverses, yet DoPE targets identity anonymity within pseudonym-based schemes and does not
apply to perturbation-based mechanisms.
Overall, existing metrics evaluate privacy within a single domain or
narrow application scope and cannot capture cross-reality linkability between broadcast messages and metaverse
activities, revealing the need for location privacy metrics tailored to 6G-enabled vehicular metaverses.
2.3
Diffusion Model-based Reinforcement Learning for Decision Optimization
Recent progress in GDMs has demonstrated strong potential in solving complex optimization problems. Du et
al. [19] surveyed GDM-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and presented a power allocation example that
GDMs can capture high-dimensional structures and generate high-quality decisions. Building on this insight, Ning
et al. [20] proposed a two-level GDM-based soft actor critic framework for effective resource management, but their
method supports only a single action type and has limited applicability. Hence, Kang et al. [21] introduced a hybrid
GDM-based DRL algorithm for digital twin migration in vehicular metaverses, jointly generating migration and
offloading actions. However, their method relies on traditional RL relaxation techniques to handle hybrid actions,
which may destabilize learning and cause suboptimal convergence during training.
To further improve hybrid
action modeling, Wang et al. [22] embedded GDMs into a hybrid proximal policy optimization algorithm through
a parameterized action formulation to optimize spectral efficiency in LEO Satellite networks. Although effective
for parameterized decision tasks, this structure imposes mutual exclusivity among actions and limits exploration
of new hybrid action pairs. Moreover, existing GDM-based DRL algorithms for optimization still depend entirely
on manually crafted reward functions, which may neglect the potentially important components in intricate cross-
reality environments. These limitations highlight the need for a new GDM-based DRL algorithm that decouples
hybrid actions and leverages large AI models to design informative reward functions.

Cross-reality Location Privacy Protection Framework in 6G-enabled Vehicular
Metaverses
In this section, we propose a cross-reality location privacy framework based on hybrid action mechanisms in 6G-
enabled vehicular metaverses. As illustrated in Fig. 1, each AV in reality is associated with an AI agent in virtuality,
which is hosted on one of the edge servers. Firstly, the key components of the 6G-enabled vehicular metaverse
are described in the network model. Subsequently, the core hybrid action mechanism is presented, focusing on
safeguarding location privacy across both physical and virtual spaces.

Network Model
• Agentic AI-driven AVs: Agentic AI-driven AVs operating in the physical space act as primary participants
in 6G-enabled vehicular metaverses. Each AV can request customized LBS, such as AR navigation, to enhance
the on-board experience throughout the journey. Although these services are essential for user immersion, the
associated service requests inevitably disclose sensitive location information, which can be exploited by adversaries
to track AV movements [10].

Workflow of the proposed cross-reality location privacy protection framework based on hybrid actions in 6G-enabled vehicular
metaverses. The sequentially numbered arrows depict the main processes: (a) The target AV at privacy risks moves and executes hybrid actions,
i.e., the continuous location perturbation and discrete privacy-aware AI agent migration (Steps 1
○to 3
○). (b) The AV requests LBS and offloads
AI agent tasks to edge servers, while malicious adversaries exploit the illegally obtained information of the target AV to launch inference attacks
(Steps 4
○to 8
○). (c) The on-board user obtains immersive metaverse applications without compromising location privacy (Step 9
○).
• AI agents: AI agents residing in the virtual space act as intelligent assistants for their corresponding AVs.
By directly interacting with other AI agents and LBS providers, AI agents empowered by large AI models can assist
AVs in processing computation-intensive tasks and providing decision-support functionalities. However, frequent
interactions and continuous migrations of AI agents may inadvertently leak location-related information [12]. To
tackle the privacy threats, the large AI model-based AI agents can support AVs with agentic AI capacities to
determine hybrid actions for cross-reality location privacy protection.
• Edge Servers: Edge servers function as the bridge between the physical and virtual spaces in 6G-enabled
vehicular metaverses.
Equipped with larger computing and storage resources than AVs, they manage the full
lifecycle of AI agents, including creation, synchronization, execution, and migration. In the 6G-enabled vehicular
metaverse, edge servers can be terrestrial RSUs or LEO satellites, where satellite nodes act as 6G base stations to
compensate for poor terrestrial connectivity in remote areas [23].
• Adversaries: Adversaries may exist in both physical and virtual spaces and are considered to possess prior
knowledge about target AVs. This consideration is reasonable, as the driving route and social interaction pattern of
an AV often exhibit temporal regularity [11]. In the physical space, adversaries can eavesdrop on broadcast sensitive
information of AVs when they request LBS. In the virtual space, adversaries may be malicious AI agents or metaverse
service providers aiming to infer user locations, particularly during AI agent migrations. Furthermore, adversaries
across physical and virtual spaces may share information to launch collusive inference attacks to associate an AV
with its AI agent, posing a significant threat to the location privacy of on-board users [12].
3.2
Hybrid Action-based Cross-reality Privacy Protection Mechanism
To conceal user location in 6G-enabled vehicular metaverses, the proposed cross-reality location privacy protection
framework adopts a hybrid action mechanism consisting of a continuous action for location perturbation in the
physical space and a discrete action for privacy-aware AI agent migration in virtual spaces. See the details below.

3.2.1
Continuous action—location perturbation in reality
We consider there are multiple agentic AI-driven AVs, multiple RSUs, and an LEO satellite in an observation
area.
Specifically, we denote an AV set M = {1, . . . , m, . . . , M} with a total of M AVs and an RSU set N =
{1, . . . , n, . . . , N} with a total of N RSUs, while the index of the LEO satellite is denoted as S. In the physical
space, location perturbation (also called location obfuscation) can be applied to AV trajectories to reduce the
risk of direct location exposure [13].
Each AV introduces controlled perturbations to its reported coordinates
when requesting LBS. Notably, larger perturbations increase privacy by enlarging the uncertainty of an adversary’s
inference but also weaken QoS [10].
Hence, the perturbation intensity can be modeled as a continuous action
variable that is adjusted based on the privacy and QoS requirements of AVs.
The planar Laplacian perturbation mechanism proposed in [24] provides a principled approach to achieving
geo-indistinguishability based on differential privacy. This method samples random noise from a two-dimensional
Laplace distribution and perturbs the original location to satisfy ϵ-geo-indistinguishability, where ϵ denotes the
privacy budget. Inspired by this approach, the proposed framework adopts a similar mechanism to implement
continuous location perturbation in the physical space.
Let lt
m = (xt
m, yt
m) denote the true location of AV m at time slot t, where xt
m and yt
m represent the longitude
and latitude, respectively. In a polar coordinate system centered at lt
m, any relative location lx can be represented
as (rt
m, θt
m), where rt
m denotes the perturbation radius and θt
m denotes the perturbation angle with respect to the
horizontal axis. According to [24], the Probability Density Function (PDF) of the polar Laplacian distribution is
Dϵ(rt
m, θt
m) = θt
m
2
2π rt
me−ϵrt
m.
(1)
Eq. (1) reflects that perturbation is jointly determined by the continuous random variables rt
m and θt
m. Hence, to
perform location perturbation at time slot t, AV m only needs to select a continuous action policy ct
m = {rt
m, θt
m}.
Given the selected rt
m and θt
m ∈[0, 2π), the perturbed location ˜lt
m is computed as
˜lt
m = (˜xt
m, ˜yt
m) = (xt
m + rt
m cos θt
m, yt
m + rt
m sin θt
m).
(2)
The detailed procedure for determining ct
m with the LLM-enhanced learning approach is presented in Section 5.
3.2.2
Discrete action—privacy-aware AI agent migration in virtuality
In the virtual domain, AI agent migration serves not only to sustain continuous service provisioning under the
mobility of AVs, but also as an effective mechanism for enhancing location privacy [11]. By dynamically changing
the hosting edge server of an AI agent, the one-to-one correspondence between an AV and a specific server can be
disrupted, thereby introducing uncertainty into the inferred locations of AVs and reducing privacy risks. However,
if an AV always migrates its AI agent to the server offering the strongest signal strength, an adversary continuously
monitoring the target AI agent can still reconstruct the real trajectory of the target AV. Conversely, migrating the
AI agent to a distant edge server may increase service response latency and degrade user immersion in 6G-enabled
vehicular metaverses. To address this tradeoff, privacy-aware AI agent migration is modeled as a discrete action,
where an AV optimally selects whether and where to migrate its agent among edge server candidates, achieving a
dynamic balance between location privacy protection and service latency reduction.
Let ct
m denote the index of the edge server connected to AV m at time slot t. In a 6G-enabled vehicular metaverse,
each AV is connected to exactly one edge server in each time slot, which is expressed as 1(ct
m ∈N)+1(ct
m = S) = 1,
where 1(·) is the indicator function. Meanwhile, let et
m denote the index of the edge server that hosts the AI agent
of AV m, referred to as the agent server. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the glowing RSU na ∈N represents the edge server
providing the strongest signal to AV m at its initial position, serving both as the connected edge server and the
initial agent server. When AV m moves out of the coverage range of RSU na, it connects to another RSU nb ∈N
that offers the strongest signal at the new position. However, the connected server nb is not necessarily selected as
the agent server. After evaluating the current location privacy level, AV m may instead choose an alternative RSU
nc (nc ∈N) to balance privacy protection and service latency based on its discrete action decision policy dt
m = nc.
Therefore, to protect location privacy in the virtual space, the agentic AI-driven AV m can determine its discrete
action policy dt
m = {et
m | 1(et
m ∈N) + 1(et
m = S) = 1} for privacy-aware AI agent migration in time slot t. The
detailed procedure for determining dt
m with the LLM-enhanced learning approach is presented in Section 5.

System Model
Based on the above analysis, the core of the proposed framework for achieving cross-reality location privacy pro-
tection is to determine the optimal hybrid action, striking a balance between location privacy protection and user
immersion. To achieve this, we design a new privacy metric named cross-reality location entropy to evaluate privacy
levels under the hybrid action mechanisms. Meanwhile, the service response latency and QoS loss are explicitly
modeled. By integrating these components, the overall optimization problem is formulated in Section 4.4.
4.1
New Privacy Metric: Cross-reality Location Entropy
Before determining the hybrid action for cross-reality location privacy protection, it is essential for AV m to evaluate
its current privacy level. When the assessed privacy level is high, AV m can prioritize its immersive experience
within the metaverse, meaning that it can request LBS with accurate locations and deploy its AI agent on a nearby
edge server.
In contrast, AV m can adopt a more aggressive protection strategy, requesting LBS with largely
perturbed positions and migrating its AI agent to a more distant edge server.
As discussed in Section 3.1, adversaries can obtain partial historical movement trajectories of target AVs. With
this side information, an adversary can analyze the migration pattern of the target AV and conduct a Bayesian
location inference attack, which is a type of knowledge-based attack [11]. Combining past movement traces and
migration patterns, adversaries can build a mapping relationship between AV location in reality and AI agent
location in virtuality, learning the probability distribution of the AV’s real-time actual position. Specifically, let
Pr(˘lt
m = pa), Pr(˜lt
m = pb), and Pr(ˆlt
m = pc) represent the probability of the inferred AV location, perturbed AV
location, and corresponding AI agent location of AV m is located at the position pa, pb, and pc, respectively. Then,
the posterior distribution of AV m’s location is obtained by observing the perturbed AV location in reality and the
AI agent location in virtuality based on the multi-condition Bayes’ theorem, given by
Pr(˘lt
m = pa | ˜lt
m = pb, ˆlt
m = pc) = Pr(˘lt
m = pa, ˜lt
m = pb, ˆlt
m = pc)
Pr(˜ltm = pb, ˆltm = pc)
=
Pr(˜lt
m = pb, ˆlt
m = pc | ˘lt
m = pa) Pr(˘lt
m = pa)
P
px∈Ptm Pr(˜ltm = pb, ˆltm = pc | ltm = px) Pr(ltm = px)
,
(3)
where Pt
m is the set of potential physical locations of AV m in time slot t.
Since the perturbed location and
AI agent location are each determined solely based on the hybrid action strategy of AV m, the two conditional
probabilities can be treated as mutually independent when the physical AV location is given. In this case, the
posterior distribution in Eq. (3) is transformed into
Pr(˘lt
m = pa | ˜lt
m = pb, ˆlt
m = pc) =
Pr(˜lt
m = pb | ˘lt
m = pa) Pr(ˆlt
m = pc | ˘lt
m = pa) Pr(˘lt
m = pa)
P
px∈Ptm Pr(˜ltm = pb | ltm = px) Pr(ˆltm = pc | ltm = px) Pr(ltm = px)
.
(4)
To assess the privacy levels of AVs in 6G-enabled vehicular metaverses, we design a new physical-virtual location
privacy metric based on information entropy, referred to as cross-reality location entropy.
Definition 1.
(Cross-reality Location Entropy) In the 6G-enabled vehicular metaverse, the cross-reality
location entropy of an AV m at time slot t is defined as
Et
m = −
X
pa∈Ptm
Pr(˘lt
m = pa | ˜lt
m = pb, ˆlt
m = pc) log2

Pr(˘lt
m = pa | ˜lt
m = pb, ˆlt
m = pc)

.
(5)
Notably, the cross-reality location entropy in Eq. (5) is established based on the concept of entropy in information
theory [25]. A larger entropy value implies a lower accuracy of the adversary’s inference regarding the actual location
of the target AV, indicating a lower risk of location privacy leakage. With this metric, AVs can evaluate their
location privacy levels across physical and virtual spaces, thereby guiding hybrid action mechanisms to maintain
an appropriate balance between location privacy and user immersion in 6G-enabled vehicular metaverses.

The communication model describes the wireless transmission processes between AVs and edge servers. To maintain
accurate physical–virtual synchronization and receive high-quality metaverse services, AVs should upload real-time

tasks through uplink channels [9]. Consider the case where the AI agent of AV m is deployed on RSU n in the
virtual space during time slot t, i.e., et
m = n. Let ˆlt
m = ln = {xn, yn} denote the position of agent server et
m, which
corresponds to the fixed geographical coordinates of RSU n, with xn and yn representing its longitude and latitude,
respectively. The longitudinal difference between AV m and RSU n is thus given by ∆xt
m,n =
π
180 (xt
m −xn), while
the latitudinal difference is ∆yt
m,n =
π
180(yt
m −yn). Therefore, the haversine of the central angle θt
m,n (in radians) is

From Eq. (6), we know that θt

m,n = Rθt
m,n = 2R arcsin

(7)
where R = 6371 km denotes the radius of the Earth.
For vehicular systems, the Rayleigh fading model is commonly used to characterize the wireless channel between
RSUs and AVs [2]. The channel gain is defined as ht
m,n = A
h
c

iξ
, where c = 3 × 108 m/s is the speed of

In addition to uplink transmission, AVs also receive customized AI agent task results from the RSU via the down-
link channel to obtain personalized metaverse services (e.g., AR navigation to a preferred destination). Considering
channel reciprocity, the uplink and downlink share identical path-loss characteristics [21]. Accordingly, the downlink

Since the connected edge server may differ from the agent server, the communication model also accounts for the
backhaul latency incurred during data transmission between them. This latency only arises in ground-to-ground
RSU links, as satellite nodes typically possess sufficient onboard computing resources, eliminating the need for
AVs connected to satellites to offload AI agent tasks to terrestrial RSUs. The backhaul latency consists of two
components: the wired transmission latency and the relay latency, where the latter is influenced by processing,
forwarding, and queuing delays along the relay path. Therefore, the backhaul latency is expressed as

Migration model
According to Section 3.2.2, a moving AV m executes a discrete action, namely privacy-aware AI agent migration,
to balance location privacy and service latency, which introduces migration latency. Let Sm denote the AI agent
model size of AV m. The incurred migration latency of AV m between the previous agent server and the current
one is then computed as

Computation model
In addition to wireless communication and migration operations, the process of delivering metaverse services to AVs
by AI agents also incurs computation latency at the agent server. Specifically, the agent server et
m is responsible
for AI agent updates and task processing for the agentic AI-driven AV m, resulting in the computation latency as

m
(t) = ιDup
m (t) is the size of the requested AI agent task created based on the upload data
with ι denoting the conversion factor. fn and fsat are the CPU frequency of RSU n and satellite S, respectively.
Finally, by integrating the communication latency, migration latency, and computation latency, the total service
response latency experienced by AV m in time slot t is expressed as
Lt

4.3
Penalties for QoS Loss
QoS is another critical requirement in 6G-enabled vehicular metaverses. When agentic AI-driven AVs travel and
request splendid LBS, injecting excessive noise into their status messages can decline the QoS, thus leading to
poor metaverse experiences, such as offset scenario rendering and improper site recommendation.
To prevent
such situations, a penalty term for QoS loss regarding the distance between the actual and perturbed locations is
introduced to constrain large-scale continuous actions. According to Eq. (2), the perturbed location of AV m after
applying the continuous action is ˜lt
m = (˜xt
m, ˜yt
m). Referring to the distance calculation formula in Eq. (7), we define
the penalty for QoS loss as

Problem Formulation
Generally, the proposed framework requires each agentic AI-driven AV to determine how to perturb its physical
location and migrate its AI agent to protect cross-reality location privacy and ensure user immersion by maintaining
service response latency and QoS. Consequently, the utility function of AV m is defined as
ut
m = ωEEt
m −ωLLt
m −ωQQt
m,
(17)
where ωE, ωL, and ωQ represent the weighting factors for the cross-reality location entropy, service response latency,
and QoS loss, respectively. Finally, the overall optimization problem of the proposed hybrid action mechanisms in
the 6G-enabled vehicular metaverse is formulated as
P1 :

(18b)
θt
m ∈[0, 2π),
(18c)
1(et
m ∈N) + 1(et
m = S) = 1.
(18d)
Here, rmax is the maximum perturbation radius of AVs. Constraints (18b), (18c) and (18d) limit the value ranges
of the optimization variables.
It is observed that the formulated problem P1 is a complex non-convex mixed-
integer programming problem. Since cross-reality location privacy preservation is persistent and varies over time,
traditional convex optimization methods that provide only single-round static solutions are often invalid. Moreover,
the long-term coupling among consecutive decisions in dynamic vehicular metaverse scenarios makes learning-based
methods more suitable than conventional optimization for achieving sustained privacy and immersion performance.

LLM-enhanced Hybrid GDM-based Reinforcement Learning Solution
Although it is difficult to solve the optimization problem directly, the problem P1 exhibits a memoryless sequential
decision-making structure that satisfies the Markov property. Based on this observation, we model the hybrid action
decision process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) [11]. Moreover, large AI models exhibit a strong ability to
understand contextual information in highly dynamic systems, among which LLMs are particularly effective at
reasoning over abstract objectives and discovering latent performance indicators. Motivated by recent advances in
LLM-enhanced reinforcement learning [26], we propose an LLM-enhanced Hybrid Diffusion-based Proximal Policy
Optimization (LHDPPO) algorithm to solve the complex optimization problem P1.
5.1
Markov Decision Process Modeling
5.1.1
Environment state
Let ˇlt
m denote the position of the connected server ct
m. Thus, the state space of AV m in the current time slot
t ∈{1, 2, . . . , T} is defined as a union of the real-time vehicle location lt
m, the location of the connected edge server
ˇlt
m, and the location of the edge server hosting the AI agent in the previous slot ˆlt−1
m , which is represented by
st
m ≜{lt
m, ˙θt
m, ˇlt
m, ˆlt−1
m }.
(19)
Therefore, the state space in the MDP is the aggregation of the states of all AVs, denoted as st = {st
m}M
m=1.
5.1.2
Action space
At each time slot t, each agentic AI-driven AV autonomously determines a hybrid action, consisting of a set of
continuous action at
m including the perturbation radius rt
m and perturbation angle θt
m in reality, and a discrete
action dt
m, i.e., the AI agent migration decision et
m in virtuality. Therefore, the action of AV m is denoted as
at
m ≜{ct
m, dt
m} = {rt
m, θt
m, et
m}. Consequently, the action space in the MDP is defined as at = {ct, dt} = {at
m}M
m=1.
5.1.3
Reward function
The reward function characterizes the immediate feedback received by AVs after executing the hybrid action at
under the environment state st, which plays a vital role in guiding policy updates in MDP. A well-designed reward
function should accurately reflect the system objective and provide informative gradients to facilitate stable and
reliable policy updates. Intuitively, assigning the reward to be directly equal to the utility of AVs encourages the
policy network to generate hybrid actions that jointly enhance location privacy, latency, and QoS performance.
Following this principle, the reward function is designed as
Rman(st, at) = 1
M
M
X
m=1
ut
m.
(20)
However, such manually crafted rewards are often limited to predefined objective terms and penalty components,
and may fail to capture implicit interactions among location privacy, service response latency, and QoS in the
complex cross-reality vehicular metaverse scenario, potentially leading to suboptimal convergence.

LHDPPO Algorithm Details
5.2.1
LLM-driven reward function design loop
Instead of relying solely on manual formulations that may neglect the important environmental components, the
proposed LHDPPO algorithm employs an LLM as an autonomous reward designer to generate more informative
reward functions. This design philosophy is consistent with the role of agentic AI, where the LLM is integrated into
the reinforcement learning loop to enhance policy learning through adaptive reward shaping.
As illustrated in Fig. 2, the LLM-driven reward design follows an iterative loop consisting of three main stages.
Stage 1: Initial reward generation: The LLM is first prompted with three categories of inputs to produce a
set of candidate reward functions. These inputs include
• Role assignment: The prompt instructs the LLM to act as an experienced and professional reward designer
with expertise in wireless communications, security and privacy, and deep reinforcement learning.
• Environment description: The prompt provides a detailed description of the 6G-enabled vehicular metaverse
scenario together with the complete environment code, including the MDP formulation and parameter configuration.
• Output specification: The prompt requires the LLM to generate reward functions in a structured JSON format,
accompanied by executable Python code that can be directly integrated into the simulation environment.
Stage 2: Selective reward evaluation: Based on the generated candidate reward functions, domain experts
selectively retain those that are suitable for training and discard unreasonable ones, such as functions that assign
excessive weight to a single term. Each retained reward function is then evaluated through interactions with the
environment, and key performance indicators such as achieved location entropy and service latency are collected.
Stage 3: Circular reward refinement: The evaluation results from Stage 2 are standardized and fed back
to the LLM as refinement prompts. Guided by explicit performance comparisons and optional human preferences,
the LLM iteratively updates and improves the reward formulations by emphasizing influential components that are
often overlooked in manual designs, such as the coupled effects of privacy, latency, and QoS. This closed reward
design loop continues until convergence to a high-performing reward function, as shown on the left of Fig. 2.
After multiple refinement rounds, the LLM outputs the most informative reward function for cross-reality location
privacy protection, which is finally adopted by the learning agent:

the optimized weighting factors obtained through multiple rounds of LLM-guided reward refinement, which yield
superior learning performance. Compared with Rman(·), the LLM-generated reward incorporates latent yet critical
indicators and explicitly balances location privacy with user immersion, enabling the proposed LHDPPO algorithm
to better improve policy robustness and convergence performance in 6G-enabled vehicular metaverses.
5.2.2
Double-chain GDM-based PPO training loop
Beyond the LLM-driven reward design, the proposed LHDPPO algorithm integrates powerful GDMs that can
model complex, high-dimensional distributions through multi-step denoising processes, enabling structured action
exploration in the highly coupled decision space of 6G-enabled vehicular metaverses. Specifically, LHDPPO leverages
two diffusion policies to handle continuous and discrete actions, respectively, jointly forming the hybrid policy as
πψ(at|st) = πc
ψc(c|s) πd
ψd(d|s),
(22)
where c = {ϵm, θm}M
m=1 denotes the continuous actions for location perturbation and d = {em}M
m=1 denotes the
discrete actions for privacy-aware AI agent migration. The key idea of GDM-based algorithms is to exploit the
reverse diffusion process to progressively refine actions from noise into feasible solutions, thereby enabling effective
exploration for near-optimal hybrid actions. This generative denoising process is conceptually described as
pψ(x0:U|s) = N(xU; 0, I)
U
Y
u=1
pψ(xu−1|xu, s),
(23)
where U is the number of denoising steps, I is the covariance matrix, and x0 is the final output of the reverse chain.
The reverse diffusion chain {pψ(xu−1|xu, s)}U
u=1 is modeled as a sequence of conditional Gaussian transitions,
pψ(xu−1|xu, s) = N(xu−1; µψ(xu, s, u), Σψ(xu, s, u)) ,
(24)
where the covariance follows a predefined variance schedule Σψ(xu, s, u) = βuI and the mean is parameterized via
the noise prediction network εψ as
µψ(xu, s, u) =
1
√αu

xu −
βu
√1 −¯αu
εψ(xu, s, u)

,
(25)
with αu = 1 −βu and ¯αu = Qu
k=1 αk.
Accordingly, the hybrid policy πψ(at|st) is realized by executing the reverse diffusion process from xU ∼N(0, I)
to x0, where the final denoised sample x0 corresponds to the executed action at. The same reverse diffusion principle
is applied to both continuous and discrete components, yielding c and d, respectively. Consequently, optimizing
the policy πψ in the high-dimensional vehicular metaverse environment is equivalent to optimizing the denoising
networks εc
ψc and εd
ψd that govern the reverse diffusion dynamics of the continuous and discrete action spaces. These
denoising networks fully determine the action distribution and finally the behavior of the learning agent.
At time slot t, the hybrid log-probability of the executed action generated by the diffusion policy is computed as
log πψ(at|st) = log πc
ψc(ct|st) + log πd
ψd(dt|st).
(26)
In LHDPPO, both the continuous and discrete policies are implemented by diffusion-based actors that execute
the reverse diffusion chain in a mean-only denoising mode. The stochasticity required for policy optimization is
solely introduced by the final distributions, which ensures tractable likelihood evaluation and stable PPO updates.
For the continuous component, the diffusion actor produces a mean µψc(st), and the continuous policy is then
modeled as a Gaussian distribution, given by
πc
ψc(ct|st) = N
 ct; µψc(st), diag(σ2
ψc)

,
(27)
where the log-variance vector σψc is learned jointly with the diffusion model parameters. This construction enables
the PPO policy gradient to propagate through the log-probability of the sampled action into the continuous denoising
network εc
ψc, thereby shaping the reverse diffusion dynamics according to long-term system performance.
For the discrete component, a diffusion-based denoising network generates the categorical logits for each AV,
from which the migration action et
m is sampled. Then, the corresponding log-probability is computed by
log πd
ψd(dt|st) =
M
X
m=1
log Cat(et
m | logitsm(st)).
(28)


--- Page 12 ---
Sci China Inf Sci
12
The gradients of this log-probability propagate through the diffusion-generated logits and update the discrete denois-
ing network εd
ψd, thereby completing the coupling between diffusion modeling and PPO-based policy optimization.
For PPO updates, we denote πψold as the old hybrid behavior policy, and the importance ratio is computed as
ρt(ψ) =
πψ(at|st)
πψold(at|st) = exp
 log πψ(at|st) −log πψold(at|st)

.
(29)
In LHDPPO, a learned value-based critic network Vϕ(s) is employed to approximate the expected value of the
current state, with parameters ϕ updated from sampled trajectories. Based on this approximation, the Generalized
Advantage Estimation (GAE) is constructed as ˆAt = P∞
l=0(γλ)lδt+l, where λ is the GAE parameter, γ is the
discount factor, and δt = rt + γVϕ(st+1) −Vϕ(st) is the Temporal-Difference (TD) residual. This advantage signal
can drive the policy update by weighting the likelihood ratio in the PPO clipped surrogate objective, given by [27]
LPPO(ψ) = −Et h
min

ρt(ψ) ˆAt, clip(ρt(ψ), 1 −κ, 1 + κ) ˆAti
,
(30)
where κ ∈[0, 1] is the clipping parameter.
The gradient of this objective is backpropagated through the log-
probability of the diffusion policy and ultimately updates the denoising networks εc
ψc and εd
ψd. In this manner,
LHDPPO forms another closed training loop for diffusion-based action generation, environment interaction, reward
evaluation, and PPO updates are tightly coupled, as shown on the right of Fig. 2.
Meanwhile, the value network is trained using the clipped value loss, calculated by
LVϕ = 1
2 Et h
max

(Vϕ(st) −ˆRt)2, (Vclip(st) −ˆRt)2i
.
(31)
Here, ˆRt = ˆAt + Vϕ(st) is the return target for value learning. Vclip(st) = Vold(st) + clip(Vϕ(st) −Vold(st), −κ, κ)
is the clipped value prediction used to prevent excessively large value updates, with Vold(st) denoting the value
estimate stored when the trajectory was collected.
To prevent premature convergence of the discrete migration policy in the extremely large action space, LHDPPO
introduces an entropy regularization loss for the discrete categorical distributions, calculated by
Lent = −ct

(32)
Here, pt
m,j = Pr(et
m = j | st) denotes the probability assigned by the discrete diffusion policy to migrating the AI
agent of AV m to candidate destination edge server j at time slot t, with j ∈N ∪{S}. ct
ent is an annealed entropy
coefficient to ensure stable exploration and efficient convergence during training.
Meanwhile, to stabilize learning of the discrete diffusion actor under the large and multi-dimensional discrete
action space, an auxiliary diffusion denoising loss is introduced. The executed migration decisions are converted
into a concatenated one-hot vector xd
0 ∈{0, 1}M(N+1) and optimized through a diffusion reconstruction objective.
This auxiliary loss is applied only to samples with a positive estimated advantage to avoid reinforcing suboptimal
behaviors, which is calculated by
Ldiff = E

i
,
(33)
where ℓdiff(xd
0, st) measures the reconstruction error of the discrete diffusion model when denoising the executed
migration vector conditioned on the state st, and is instantiated as an L1 reconstruction loss in our implementation.
Eventually, the overall training objective of the proposed LHDPPO algorithm is given by
L = LPPO + cvLVϕ + Lent + cauxLdiff,
(34)
where cv and ct
aux denote the value loss coefficient and the annealed auxiliary diffusion coefficient, respectively.

from a real-world dataset comprising approximately 840,000 base stations across China2) and filtered within the
target urban region, while a LEO satellite node is incorporated to provide ubiquitous 6G connectivity in remote
areas at the boundary of the map. Referring to [9, 11, 29], the environmental parameters and hyperparameters
adopted in the experiments are presented on the right of Fig. 3. In addition, the performance of the proposed
LHDPPO algorithm is compared with the following representative baseline methods:
• Geo-Indistinguishability (Geo-I) [24]: A non-learning method that perturbs location based on differential
privacy, and employs a greedy strategy to select the agent server with the best historical performance.
• Hybrid PPO (H-PPO) [30]: A classical hybrid reinforcement learning algorithm in which discrete action
selection and continuous parameter optimization are trained in parallel using PPO.
• GDMs-assisted Hybrid PPO (GHPPO) [22]: An extension of H-PPO that introduces a generative diffu-
sion model for discrete action generation while modeling continuous actions using parameterized policies.
• Hybrid-GDM (HGDM) [21]: A GDM-based Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm that expresses both discrete
and continuous decisions as continuous latent variables and maps them to executable hybrid actions during inference.
• PPO-relaxed [27]: A PPO-based algorithm employing clipped surrogate objectives and GAE for stable policy
updates, where discrete migration actions are similarly relaxed into continuous values for tractable training.
• HDPPO: A variant of the proposed LHDPPO that employs double diffusion chains for hybrid action decisions
but removes the LLM-driven reward design loop, in order to evaluate the contribution of reward refinement.
6.2
Numerical Results
Convergence analysis. Fig. 4(a) compares the convergence behaviors of LHDPPO and representative baselines.
Overall, our LHDPPO achieves a more stable and superior convergence performance. Specifically, several base-
lines show faster short-term reward gains but then saturate at lower performance levels or suffer from persistent
oscillations, indicating difficulty in reliably optimizing the hybrid action mechanism. Moreover, the gap between
LHDPPO and HDPPO verifies the effectiveness of the LLM-based reward design loop. By refining the reward to
better capture the cross-reality privacy-utility coupling, LHDPPO is guided toward more stable and higher-quality
policies. Fig. 4(b) further studies the impact of the learning rate on LHDPPO. When the learning rate becomes
larger (e.g., 10−3 or 10−2), the policy updates become more aggressive, resulting in larger variance and making the
training more likely to converge to suboptimal solutions. In contrast, an overly small learning rate (e.g., 5 × 10−5)
makes parameter updates overly conservative, which slows down convergence and delays performance improvement.
Specifically, compared with a learning rate of 10−3, adopting a moderate learning rate of 10−4 improves the final
convergence reward by approximately 61.9%, motivating the use of a moderate learning rate (i.e., 10−4) to ensure
reliable policy refinement. Fig. 4(c) evaluates the influence of the diffusion denoising steps. Increasing the denoising
steps generally improves early-stage learning efficiency, as higher-step diffusion can generate higher-quality hybrid
action samples for policy optimization. However, excessively large denoising steps may introduce additional train-
ing variance. Quantitatively, compared with 7 denoising steps, the default setting of 5 steps improves the final
convergence reward by approximately 58.3%. Therefore, an intermediate denoising-step setting achieves the best
tradeoff between convergence stability and final reward.

Performance comparison between the proposed LHDPPO algorithm and the baseline methods.
Performance analysis. Fig. 5 compares the averaged test performance of the proposed LHDPPO with rep-
resentative baseline schemes under the cross-reality location privacy protection framework. As shown in Fig. 5(a),
HDPPO, which integrates two diffusion chains without LLM assistance, already achieves strong performance with
a high utility, confirming the effectiveness of diffusion-based hybrid action exploration. LHDPPO further enhances
environmental understanding via LLM-driven reward design, leading to the highest AV utility, outperforming the
second-best method HDPPO by 15.6% and the strongest non-diffusion baseline PPO-relaxed by 27.6%. This demon-
strates that the proposed LHDPPO method strikes the most favorable balance between location privacy and user
immersion. Fig. 5(b) shows that LHDPPO attains the highest cross-reality location entropy of 0.743, surpassing the
classic privacy-preserving scheme Geo-I by 48.9%, demonstrating its effectiveness in resisting cross-reality inference
attacks. Fig. 5(c) shows that LHDPPO yields the lowest average service response latency, achieving a 9.3% reduction
compared with HDPPO and reductions exceeding 35% relative to most baselines, such as GHPPO and HGDM,
indicating that the privacy improvement does not rely on excessive AI agent migrations that degrade latency. Fig-
ure 5(d) illustrates the QoS loss performance of different methods. Although GHPPO achieves the smallest QoS
loss, it performs the worst in terms of privacy protection and latency performance. In contrast, LHDPPO delivers
the strongest privacy protection and the lowest service latency while maintaining an acceptable QoS loss, ensuring
both robust location privacy and high-quality immersive experiences for on-board users.
LLM influence analysis. To investigate why LHDPPO works, Fig. 6 illustrates how cross-reality location
entropy varies under the hybrid action mechanism. The surface plot shows that the perturbation radius in the
continuous action primarily dominates the entropy variation, while further privacy gains can be achieved by ad-
justing the included angle αt
m, which is jointly determined by the perturbation angle in the continuous action and
the selected agent server in the discrete migration action. This reveals a strong coupling between the physical
perturbed location and the virtual AI agent location: even with a fixed perturbation distance, different relative
orientations between the AV and the selected agent server lead to substantially different location privacy levels.
The reason is that the difference in direction between the disturbance location and the agent deployment location
can simultaneously increase the probabilities of multiple observation points, thereby increasing the uncertainty of
the posterior distribution. Through the LLM-driven reward design loop, LHDPPO identifies αt
m as a latent but
crucial indicator and introduces an additional reward shaping term to encourage a larger discrepancy between the
perturbation direction and the server direction, so that the learned policy is guided toward the high-entropy angular
peaks rather than only enlarging the perturbation distance.

Privacy metric analysis. Fig. 7 compares the evaluated privacy levels with the attacker confidence as the
hybrid action intensity increases. We consider two representative baselines about privacy metrics: Geo-I-based
entropy for physical location perturbation [24] and location entropy for virtual service migration [11]. A credible
privacy metric should show a clear inverse relationship with attacker confidence. However, the Geo-I-based entropy
and location entropy fail to satisfy this requirement. When the attacker confidence is high (e.g., action intensity
from 0 to 20, confidence close to 1.0), their evaluated privacy levels are not correspondingly low, and their highest
privacy values do not coincide with the lowest attacker confidence. This is because both metrics capture only a
single dimension of location uncertainty and fail to account for the cross-reality privacy risks jointly induced by
AV location disclosure in the physical space and AI agent location exposure in the virtual space. In contrast, the
proposed cross-reality location entropy explicitly models this characteristic, yielding privacy evaluations that are
consistently aligned with attacker confidence. This property is crucial for reinforcement learning, as it provides a
reliable and informative reward signal for stable and effective policy optimization.
Case study in real scenarios. Fig. 8 presents a real-map example to illustrate how the proposed framework
performs cross-reality location privacy protection in practice. The red polyline denotes the actual AV trajectory,
while the green polyline shows the perturbed trajectory generated by the learned privacy policy. We can observe that
the policy produces reasonable perturbations along the route, so that the released locations deviate from the true
path while avoiding excessive QoS degradation. Moreover, the framework jointly controls the virtual-space decision
by dynamically selecting agent servers at different time instants. As shown in Fig. 8, the selected agent servers
are distributed around the neighborhoods of both the actual and perturbed trajectories, rather than being fixed
to a single closest server. This coupled strategy maximally confuses the attacker by preventing a consistent cross-
reality alignment between the reported physical trajectory and the observed AI agent deployment, thereby reducing
attacker confidence in tracing the true route. The real-world experiments indicate that the proposed cross-reality
location privacy protection framework maintains privacy protection and user immersion across dynamic vehicular
environments, demonstrating a certain degree of generalizability.

Conclusion
This paper has proposed a cross-reality location privacy protection framework to mitigate cross-reality location pri-
vacy leakage for agentic AI-driven AVs in 6G-enabled vehicular metaverses.By adopting a hybrid action mechanism
that jointly employs continuous location perturbation in reality and discrete privacy-aware AI agent migration in
virtuality, the proposed framework achieves unified cross-reality location privacy preservation while maintaining user
immersion. A cross-reality location entropy metric has been designed to quantify the uncertainty of AV positions
under hybrid actions and to support real-time privacy assessment. Combining location privacy, service latency,
and QoS loss, a non-convex mixed-integer programming problem has been established for optimizing the hybrid
action mechanism. To address the formulated problem, we have developed an LLM-enhanced Hybrid Diffusion
Proximal Policy Optimization (LHDPPO) algorithm, which combines LLM-driven informative reward design with
double GDMs-based policy exploration and PPO-based stable policy updates to improve learning performance and
scalability. Extensive experiments on real-world mobility and base station datasets have demonstrated that the
proposed framework effectively protects location privacy while ensuring immersion for on-board users, indicating its
practical applicability for large-scale 6G-enabled vehicular metaverse deployments. Future work will explore how
heterogeneous AV mobility patterns, from correlated commuting routes to random delivery trajectories, affect the
privacy–immersion trade-off and how adaptive mechanisms can provide more balanced privacy protection.
