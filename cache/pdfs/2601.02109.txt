Finite-State Decentralized Policy-Based Control With
Guaranteed Ground Coverage
Hossein Rastgoftar
Abstract—We propose a finite-state, decentralized decision
and control framework for multi-agent ground coverage. The
approach decomposes the problem into two coupled components:
(i) the structural design of a deep neural network (DNN) induced
by the agents’ reference configuration, and (ii) policy-based
decentralized coverage control. Agents are classified as anchors
and followers, yielding a generic and scalable communication
architecture in which each follower interacts with exactly three
in-neighbors from the preceding layer, forming an enclosing
triangular communication structure. The DNN training weights
implicitly encode the spatial configuration of the agent team,
thereby providing a geometric representation of the environmen-
tal target set. Within this architecture, we formulate a compu-
tationally efficient decentralized Markov decision process (MDP)
whose components are time-invariant except for a time-varying
cost function defined by the deviation from the centroid of the
target set contained within each agent’s communication triangle.
By introducing the concept of Anyway Output Controllability
(AOC), we assume each agent is AOC and establish decentralized
convergence to a desired configuration that optimally represents
the environmental target.
I. INTRODUCTION
Multi-agent ground coverage is a fundamental problem in
distributed control with applications in environmental moni-
toring, surveillance, and distributed sensing. A classical and
widely adopted approach is Voronoi-based coverage control,
in which agents iteratively move toward the centroids of their
Voronoi cells to optimize a spatial coverage objective in a
decentralized manner. This paradigm admits strong geomet-
ric interpretability and convergence guarantees and has been
extensively studied and extended, including density-weighted
coverage, constrained environments, and event-triggered im-
plementations [7], [14], [29].
Despite these advantages, Voronoi-based methods typically
rely on continuous-time dynamics, frequent neighbor recom-
putation, and explicit geometric constructions, which limit
scalability under communication constraints and complicate
integration with discrete decision-making and learning mech-
anisms. These limitations have motivated the development
of policy-based and learning-augmented decentralized frame-
works, including finite-state and Markov decision process
formulations, to address uncertainty and scalability in multi-
agent coordination [22], [28]. While such approaches provide
increased flexibility, they often lack explicit mechanisms for
encoding formation geometry into decentralized policies or for
imposing interpretable and structured information flow with
provable convergence properties.
Hossein Rastgoftar is with the Department of Aerospace and Mechanical
Engineering, Tucson, AZ 85719, USA hrastgoftar@arizona.edu
This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a
structured, policy-based framework that tightly couples inter-
agent communication, decision-making, and physical evolu-
tion, enabling scalable decentralized coverage while preserv-
ing geometric meaning and analytical tractability.
A. Related Work
Diffusion-based convergence and stability results for multi-
agent coverage are reported in [11], while decentralized cov-
erage using local density feedback and mean-field approxima-
tions is studied in [5]. Leader–follower coverage strategies,
including explicit separation between coordination and cover-
age objectives, are investigated in [3]. Adaptive decentralized
coverage methods are explored in [10], [26], and multiscale
continuous-time convergence analyses are presented in [16].
Applications to human-centered sensing and zone coverage
planning appear in [12], [25]. A substantial body of work
adopts Voronoi-based coverage control [1], [4], [18], [19],
typically establishing convergence via Lyapunov-based argu-
ments under kinematic or single-integrator agent abstractions.
Extensions addressing obstacles, failures, and leader–follower
structures are considered in [4], while experimental compar-
isons in complex urban environments are reported in [21].
Coverage control for heterogeneous agent teams has also re-
ceived increasing attention. Authors of [24] propose a hetero-
geneous coverage control framework that encodes qualitatively
different sensing capabilities through agent-specific density
functions in a locational cost, deriving a distributed gradient-
descent controller with additional boundary terms that ensures
convergence to critical points of the heterogeneous coverage
objective and demonstrates improved performance over het-
erogeneous Lloyd-type methods in experiments. A Voronoi-
based coverage control method for heterogeneous disk-shaped
robots, leveraging power diagrams and constrained centroidal
motion to ensure collision-free convergence to locally optimal
sensing configurations, is proposed in [2]. Sadeghi and Smith
address coverage control for multiple event types with hetero-
geneous robots by formulating an event-specific Voronoi par-
titioning framework and deriving distributed algorithms with
provable convergence to locally optimal sensing configurations
in both continuous and discrete environments [23]. A coverage
control framework for robots with heterogeneous maximum
speeds is presented in [15], formulating a temporal cost based
on multiplicatively weighted Voronoi diagrams and deriving
a gradient-based controller that yields time-optimal coverage
configurations. More recent work considers multi-resource and
persistent surveillance objectives [6], [13].
Learning-based approaches have formulated multi-agent
coverage as a decision process using reinforcement learning
arXiv:2601.02109v1  [eess.SY]  5 Jan 2026


--- Page 2 ---
and Markov decision models [8], [9], [17], [20], [27]. While
these methods offer scalability and adaptability, they typically
rely on unstructured communication, large or continuous state
spaces, and gradient-based optimization, limiting interpretabil-
ity and convergence analysis.
To clarify the distinction from existing learning-based cov-
erage approaches, we emphasize that this paper does not treat
multi-agent coverage as a generic reinforcement learning or
function approximation problem. Instead, inter-agent commu-
nication is explicitly architected through a hierarchical anchor–
follower structure induced by a reference configuration, yield-
ing unidirectional, feedforward information flow. This struc-
ture allows the multi-agent system itself to be interpreted
as a dynamical neural network whose neurons correspond
to physical agents and whose activations are governed by
agent dynamics rather than algebraic mappings. Learning is
performed via forward-only, local updates without gradient
backpropagation or centralized critics, and each agent solves
a finite, time-invariant local Markov decision process defined
geometrically within its communication triangle. These fea-
tures fundamentally distinguish the proposed framework from
existing RL- and MDP-based coverage methods.
B. Contributions
This paper proposes a policy-based, decentralized frame-
work for coverage of unknown ground targets that scales to
arbitrarily large teams and is independent of individual agent
dynamics. The key idea is to reinterpret multi-agent coverage
as a structured dynamical system in which communication,
decision-making, and physical evolution are intrinsically cou-
pled. By organizing inter-agent communication according to a
reference configuration, the proposed approach induces a hi-
erarchical, feedforward coordination architecture that admits a
dynamical deep neural network interpretation while remaining
fully decentralized.
The main contributions are summarized as follows:
• Structured Communication and Dynamical DNN Rep-
resentation: A hierarchical anchor–follower communica-
tion architecture is introduced that induces unidirectional,
feedforward information flow, enabling the multi-agent
system to be interpreted as a dynamical neural network
whose neurons correspond to physical agents.
• Forward-Only Learning with Local Observability:
Communication weights are learned using exclusively
forward, local updates without gradient backpropagation,
centralized critics, or global information.
• Decentralized Policy Learning via Local MDPs: Each
follower agent independently learns a transition policy
by solving a finite, time-invariant local Markov decision
process defined geometrically within its communication
triangle.
• Dynamics-Agnostic Coverage via Anyway Output
Controllability: The notion of Anyway Output Control-
lability decouples policy learning from specific agent
dynamics, enabling uniform application to heterogeneous
teams with nonlinear, underactuated, or high-order dy-
namics.

presented in Section II. An algorithmic approach for structur-
ing the DNN based on the agent team’s reference configuration
is developed in Section III. Training the DNN weighsts is

and convergence of the proposed policy-based decentralized
coverage solution are proven in Section V. Simulation results

II. PROBLEM STATEMENT
We consider a team of 𝑁agents indexed by
V = {1,..., 𝑁},
tasked with providing aerial coverage of a finite set of ground
targets D. Agents are classified as boundary or interior ac-
cording to a reference configuration, and their interactions are
structured via a Delaunay neighbor network (DNN) to enable
scalable coverage. Low-level control dynamics are abstracted,
and each agent is assumed to satisfy the following output
reachability property.
Definition 1 (Anyway Output Controllability (AOC)). Let
agent 𝑖∈V be described by
(
x𝑖[𝑡+1] = f𝑖(x𝑖[𝑡],u𝑖[𝑡]) ,
r𝑖[𝑡] = h𝑖(x𝑖[𝑡]) ,
(1)
where x𝑖, u𝑖, and r𝑖denote the state, input, and output,
respectively. Agent 𝑖is said to be Anyway Output Controllable
if, for any initial state x𝑖[𝑡] ∈X𝑖, there exist an admissible input
sequence u𝑖(·) and a finite time 𝑇𝑖(x𝑖[𝑡]) < ∞such that
r𝑖[𝑡+𝑇𝑖(x𝑖[𝑡])] ∈P𝑖,
where X𝑖⊂R2 and P𝑖⊂R2 are compact sets.


--- Page 3 ---
Assumption 1. The time discretization is chosen uniformly
across agents and sufficiently large such that the output
reachability time satisfies
𝑇𝑖(x𝑖[𝑡]) = 1,
for all 𝑖∈V and all initial states x𝑖[𝑡] ∈X𝑖. Consequently,
r𝑖[𝑡+1] ∈P𝑖,
holds for any admissible initial condition.
The objective of this paper is to design a decentralized
framework that enables structured agent interactions and adap-
tive coverage of distributed targets. Specifically, we address the
following problems.
Problem 1 (DNN Structuring).
Given a reference configuration, a deterministic algorithm
uniquely induces a DNN communication architecture from
the agents’ initial spatial distribution. The agent set V is
partitioned into 𝑀+1 disjoint subsets
{V𝑙}𝑀
𝑙=0,
𝑀
Ø
𝑙=0
V𝑙= V,
where V0 consists of anchor nodes, and each agent 𝑖∈V𝑙,
𝑙≥1, has exactly three in-neighbors.
Problem
2
(Decentralized
Coverage
via
Discrete
DNN
Weights).
Design a decentralized control and learning mechanism that
enables the agent team to achieve high-level coverage of the
distributed target set D. For each agent 𝑖∈V \V0, the DNN
training weights are restricted to finite discrete sets
W𝑖=
3𝑎−𝑏
3𝑀𝑖
: 𝑎= 1,··· , 𝑀𝑖, 𝑏= 1,2

(2)
where 𝑀𝑖∈N determines the discretization resolution. These
set W𝑖consists of uniformly distributed values in (0,1),
ensuring strictly positive and bounded training weights. For
each agent 𝑖∈V \V0, let N (𝑖) denote its set of in-neighbors.
The communication weight between agent 𝑖and neighbor
𝑗∈N (𝑖) is denoted by 𝑤𝑖, 𝑗and satisfies
𝑤𝑖, 𝑗∈W𝑖,
∀𝑖∈V \V0, ∀𝑗∈N (𝑖),
(3a)
∑︁
𝑗∈N(𝑖)
𝑤𝑖, 𝑗= 1,
∀𝑖∈V \V0.
(3b)
For clarity, Fig. 1 illustrates the geometric representation
of the communication weights for 𝑀𝑖= 5, where agent 𝑖∈
V \ V0 interacts with three in-neighbors, N (𝑖) = {𝑖1,𝑖2,𝑖3}.
The corresponding discrete weight set
W𝑖= {0.067,0.133,0.267,0.333,0.467,0.533,0.667,0.733,0.867}
is obtained from (2). Problem 2 formulates the coverage prob-
lem as a decentralized MDP with time-invariant state space,
action space, state transition model, and discount factor, and a
time-varying cost function capturing coverage performance.
The detailed MDP formulation and DNN weight training
procedure are presented in Section IV.
III. STRUCTURING OF THE COVERAGE DNN
The DNN communication architecture is induced by parti-
tioning the agent set V, based on a reference configuration,
into 𝑀+1 disjoint groups indexed by M := {0,1,..., 𝑀}. This
induces the decomposition
V =
Ø
𝑙∈M
V𝑙,
V𝑙∩Vℎ= ∅, 𝑙≠ℎ,
with V𝑙⊂V and cardinality |V𝑙| = 𝑁𝑙for all 𝑙∈M. Define
the cumulative index
𝑃𝑙=
(Í𝑙
ℎ=0 𝑁ℎ,
𝑙∈M \ {0},
0,
𝑙= 0,
and index the agents by {𝑏1,...,𝑏𝑁}. Then
V𝑙= {𝑏𝑃𝑙−1+1,...,𝑏𝑃𝑙}.
(4)
To define inter-agent communication, introduce the nested
sets
L𝑙=
(
V𝑙,
𝑙∈{0, 𝑀},
V𝑙∪L𝑙−1,
otherwise,
∀𝑙∈M.
(5)
Let I(𝑖,𝑙) ⊆L𝑙−1 denote the set of neurons in layer 𝑙−1 con-
nected to neuron 𝑖∈L𝑙. The DNN architecture is induced from
the agents’ initial formation via the algorithmic procedure
in Algorithm 1, which constructs a directed graph G(V,E)
that admits a DNN representation. In particular, G(V,E)
determines: (i) the number of DNN layers (𝑀+ 1), (ii) a
partition of V into subsets V0,...,V𝑀, and (iii) the inter-
layer neuron connectivity.
Given E ⊂V × V, the in-neighbor set of agent 𝑖∈V is
defined as
N (𝑖) := { 𝑗∈V | ( 𝑗,𝑖) ∈E }.
(6)
Then, for each layer 𝑙∈M \{0}, the interconnection set I(𝑖,𝑙)
for neuron 𝑖∈L𝑙is given by
I(𝑖,𝑙) =
(
N (𝑖),
𝑖∈V𝑙= L𝑙\ L𝑙−1,
{𝑖},
𝑖∈L𝑙\V𝑙,
𝑙∈M \ {0}.
(7)
Remark 1. Algorithm 1 applies to decentralized multi-agent
systems in R𝑛; the ground coverage setting considered here
corresponds to 𝑛= 2.
For each agent 𝑖∈V, the following position-related quan-
tities are used throughout the paper:
• a𝑖: reference position of agent 𝑖in the initial (reference)
configuration.
• r𝑖[𝑡]: actual position of agent 𝑖at discrete time 𝑡, given
by the output of its control system.
• c𝑖[𝑡]: reference input to the control system of agent 𝑖at
time 𝑡; for 𝑖∈V0, c𝑖[𝑡] is constant, while for 𝑖∈V \V0,
it is defined as a weighted average of the actual positions
of its in-neighbor agents.
• p𝑖: desired position of agent 𝑖; p𝑖is known for 𝑖∈V0 and
unknown for 𝑖∈V \V0.
Moreover, for all 𝑖∈V \ V0, the reference input satisfies
c𝑖[𝑡] = p𝑖.

A. Step 1: Agent Classification
The agent set V is decomposed as V = V𝐵∪V𝐼, where V𝐵
and V𝐼are disjoint. The set V𝐵= {𝑏1,...,𝑏𝑁𝐵} consists of
the boundary agents located at the vertices of the convex hull
enclosing the interior agents in V𝐼. The polytope defined by
V𝐵is referred to as the leading polytope. Given the boundary
set V𝐵, the core agent is identified using one of two criteria:
(i) the interior agent minimizing the aggregate distance to the
boundary agents,
𝑏𝑁𝐵+1 = arg
min
𝑖∈V\V𝐵
∑︁
𝑗∈V𝐵
∥a𝑖−a𝑗∥,
(8)
or (ii) the agent located near the center of the target domain
D.
Given the set V𝐵and the designated core agent 𝑏𝑁𝐵+1, we
define the set V0 as V0 = V𝐵∪

𝑏𝑁𝐵+1
	
. According to Eq. (5),
we have V0 = L0. The leading polytope can be partitioned
into 𝑚0 distinct simplex cells. Consequently, the set L0 can
be expressed as a union of these simplices:
L0 =
𝑚0
Ø
ℎ=1
R0,ℎ,
(9)
where R0,ℎdetermines vertices of the ℎ-th simplex cell of
the leading polytope. For better clarification, an agent team
with 𝑁= 13 agents forms a 2-dimensional formation shown
in Fig. 2 (a), where V𝐵= {1,··· ,4} (𝑁𝐵= 4) defines the
boundary agents. Agent 𝑏5 = 12 ∈V is assigned by (8) as
the core leader, therefore, V0 = L0 = {1,··· ,4,12} defines
agents of the first layer. The convex hull defined by L0 can be
decomposed into 𝑚0 = 4 triangular cells with vertices defined
by R0,1 = {1,2,12}, R0,2 = {2,3,12}, R0,3 = {3,4,12}, and
R0,4 = {4,1,12}.
B. Step 2: Expansion and Structuring
Set V can be expressed as V = L𝑙−1 ∪¯L𝑙−1, for every
𝑙∈M \ {0}, where
¯L𝑙−1 = V \ L𝑙−1 defines the agents not
belonging to L𝑙−1. Note that V𝑙⊂¯L𝑙−1, if
¯L𝑙−1 ≠∅. Also,
L𝑙−1 consists of 𝑚𝑙−1 distinct simplices that cover the domain
contained by L𝑙−1. Therefore, L𝑙−1 can be expressed as:
L𝑙−1 =
𝑚𝑙−1
Ø
ℎ=1
R𝑙−1,ℎ,
𝑙∈M \ {0}
(10)
where R𝑙−1,1 through R𝑙−1,𝑚𝑙−1 are vertices of distinct simplex
cells that cover the domain contained by L𝑙−1. Given a set
R𝑙−1,ℎfor each ℎ= 1,...,𝑚𝑙−1, we denote by CONV(R𝑙−1,ℎ)
the convex hull formed by the elements of R𝑙−1,ℎ. We also
define H𝑙−1,ℎ⊂¯L𝑙−1 as the set of all nodes that lie within
this convex hull, i.e., all nodes contained in CONV(R𝑙−1,ℎ).
If H𝑙−1,ℎ≠∅, then:
• R𝑙−1,ℎhas a mentee that is determined by:
𝜇𝑙−1,ℎ= argmin
𝑗∈H𝑙−1,ℎ
©­
«
∑︁
𝑟∈R𝑙−1,ℎ
∥a𝑟−a𝑗∥ª®
¬
, ℎ= 1,··· ,𝑚𝑙−1.
(11)
• In-neighbors of 𝜇𝑙−1,ℎ∈L𝑙is defined by N  𝜇𝑙−1,ℎ
 =
R𝑙−1,ℎ.
Note that the mentee of R𝑙−1,ℎ, denoted by 𝜇𝑙−1,ℎ, does not
exist if H𝑙−1,ℎ= ∅). Then, for every 𝑙∈M\{0}, V𝑙aggengates
the mentess of all non-empty simplices of L𝑙−1 and defined
as follows:
V𝑙=

𝑖∈H𝑙−1,ℎ: H𝑙−1,ℎ≠∅, 𝑖= argmin
𝑗∈H𝑙−1,ℎ≠∅
©­
«
∑︁
𝑟∈R𝑙−1,ℎ
∥a𝑟−a𝑗∥ª®
¬
,
ℎ= 1,··· ,𝑚𝑙−1

.
(12)
Therefore, for every 𝑙∈M \ {0}, the number of agents in V𝑙
satisfies 𝑁𝑙= |V𝑙| ≤𝑚𝑙−1. This inequality holds because not
all simplices in L𝑙−1 necessarily have mentee agents assigned
to them. By knowing V𝑙and L𝑙−1, L𝑙is defined by Eq. (5).
C. Step 3: Cell Decomposition Update
If H𝑙−1,ℎ≠∅, then, 𝜇𝑙−1,ℎexists and 𝐶𝑂𝑁𝑉(R𝑙−1,ℎ) can
be decomposed into 𝑛+ 1 new simplex cells all sharing
𝜇𝑙−1,ℎ. Therefore, the leading polytope is deterministically
decomposed into 𝑚𝑙distinct simplices by knowing V𝑙, where
𝑚𝑙≤(𝑛+1)𝑚𝑙−1.
For better clarification, Fig. 2 shows how Algorithm 1 is
implemented to specify the inter-agent communication based
on the agent team reference configuration. As shown in Fig. 2
(a), 𝐶𝑂𝑁𝑉 R0,ℎ
 is a traingular cell that contains at least one
agent for ℎ= 1,··· ,4. Therefore, 𝑚1 = 12 and 𝐶𝑂𝑁𝑉 R0,ℎ

is decomposed into three tringular cells shown in Fig. 2 (a),
each shown in blue. For layer 𝑙= 1, V1 = {11,10,6,5} where
11, 10, 6, and 5 are mentors of R0,1, R0,2, R0,3, and R0,4, re-
spectively. Also, 𝑚1 = 12; R1,1 = {1,2,11}, R1,2 = {2,12,11},
R1,3 = {12,1,11}, R1,4 = {2,3,10}, R1,5 = {3,12,10}, R1,6 =
{12,2,10}, R1,7 = {3,4,6}, R1,8 = {4,12,6}, R1,9 = {12,3,6},
R1,10 = {4,1,5}, R1,11 = {1,12,5}, and R1,12 = {4,5,12} define
the verities of 12 tringular cells shown in Fig. 2 (b). As
shown in Fig. 2 (b), 𝐶𝑂𝑁𝑉 R1,ℎ
 contains a single agent

¯L = ∅,
the while loop of Algorithm 1 stops at 𝑙= 𝑀= 2, and as
a result, the DNN shown in Fig. 2 (d) specifies the inter-agent
communications.
IV. TRAINING THE DNN WEIGHTS
The DNN is trained in a fully decentralized and agent-
centric manner, wherein each agent 𝑖∈V \ V0 indepen-
dently optimizes its local communication strategy. Specifically,
agent 𝑖∈V \ V0 assigns adaptive communication weights
𝑤𝑖, 𝑗∈W𝑖to its in-neighbors 𝑗∈N (𝑖) by solving a local
MDP whose components and operation are described in Sec-
tions IV-A and IV-B, respectively. This formulation enables
scalable and communication-aware learning without central-
ized coordination, while guaranteeing coverage convergence
via the theoretical results established in Section V.
A. MDP Components
Agent 𝑖∈V \V0 is associated with an MDP defined as
M𝑖
 S𝑖,D𝑖,A𝑖,𝑔𝑖, 𝑃𝑖,C𝑖,𝛾𝑖
,
where the components of M𝑖are detailed below.
State Set: The state space of agent 𝑖∈V \ V0 is defined by
S𝑖and partitioned as
S𝑖= S𝐶
𝑖¤∪S𝑈
𝑖,
(13)
where S𝐶
𝑖and S𝑈
𝑖denote the contained and uncontained sub-
spaces, respectively. For each agent 𝑖∈V \V0, the contained
subspace S𝐶
𝑖
is obtained by discretizing the communication
triangle T𝑖[𝑡] formed by the instantaneous positions of its in-
neighbors N (𝑖). Specifically,
S𝐶
𝑖= {𝑠1,...,𝑠𝑀2
𝑖},
where 𝑀𝑖= |W𝑖| (see (2)), yielding |S𝐶
𝑖| = 𝑀2
𝑖. Each state
𝑠∈S𝐶
𝑖
corresponds to a triangular cell with centroid
c𝑖(𝑠) =
∑︁
𝑗∈N(𝑖)
𝑤𝑖, 𝑗(𝑠)r𝑗,
𝑠∈S𝐶
𝑖,
(14)
where the barycentric weights 𝑤𝑖, 𝑗∈W𝑖satisfy (3). The
uncontained subspace S𝑈
𝑖is represented by a single aggregate
state capturing all positions outside T𝑖[𝑡]. Fig. 3 illustrates the
resulting discretization.
Local Target Set: Let d 𝑗: D →R2 denote the position
of environmental target 𝑗∈D. The set of targets locally
observable by agent 𝑖∈V \V0 is defined as
D𝑖[𝑡] = { 𝑗∈D : d 𝑗[𝑡] ∈T𝑖[𝑡]},
∀𝑖∈V \V0.
(15)
Action Set: The action space A𝑖encodes admissible transi-
tions over S𝑖and is defined as a mapping A𝑖: S𝑖→S𝑖. Two
triangular cells are considered neighbors if they share a com-
mon edge. Accordingly, each state in S𝐶
𝑖admits at most three
neighboring cells, resulting in at most four actions (including
self-transition). If 𝑠∈S𝐶
𝑖, then A𝑖(𝑠) ⊆S𝐶
𝑖, whereas actions
from 𝑠∈S𝑈
𝑖transition into the contained subspace. Fig. 3(b)–
(d) illustrates this construction.
Goal State: The goal state 𝑔𝑖∈S𝐶
𝑖
is selected to maximize
the coverage quality of the local target set D𝑖. Define
h𝑖[𝑡] =


1
|D𝑖[𝑡]|
∑︁
𝑗∈D𝑖[𝑡]
d 𝑗[𝑡],
D𝑖[𝑡] ≠∅,
1
3
∑︁
𝑗∈N(𝑖)
r𝑗[𝑡],
D𝑖[𝑡] = ∅,
(16)
which represents the centroid of the locally sensed targets
when available, and otherwise the centroid of the communi-
cation triangle. The goal state 𝑔𝑖is then defined as the unique
triangular cell containing h𝑖[𝑡].
Transition Dynamics: The transition kernel is modeled as
a linear combination of fixed base transition measures. Let
Φ𝑖: S𝑖×A𝑖→R𝑑denote a feature map, and let {𝜇𝑖, 𝑗}𝑑
𝑗=1 be
graph-constrained base transition distributions. The resulting
transition kernel is
𝑃𝑖(· | 𝑠,𝑎) =
𝑑
∑︁
𝑗=1
𝜙𝑖, 𝑗(𝑠,𝑎) 𝜇𝑖, 𝑗(·),
∀𝑖∈V \V0.
(17)
Cost Function: Let ¯r(𝑠) denote the centroid of the triangular
cell associated with state 𝑠∈S𝑖. The MDP employs a state-
dependent cost function defined as
C𝑖(𝑠) =
(
𝛼
¯r(𝑠) −¯r(𝑔𝑖)
,
𝑠≠𝑔𝑖,
𝛼
¯r(𝑠) −¯r(𝑔𝑖)
−𝛽,
𝑠= 𝑔𝑖,
(18)
where 𝛼> 0 and 𝛽> 0 are design parameters. The term
proportional to 𝛼penalizes deviation from the goal state 𝑔𝑖,
while the terminal reward 𝛽incentivizes reaching the goal.

B. Operation
An agent 𝑖∈V \ V0 may lie either inside or outside its
communication triangle T𝑖[𝑡] at time 𝑡. If the agent position
satisfies r𝑖[𝑡] ∉T𝑖[𝑡], we set 𝑀𝑖= 1. In this case, the corre-
sponding MDP state satisfies 𝑠∈S𝑈
𝑖, the contained subspace
reduces to a singleton |S𝐶
𝑖| = 1, and the action mapping
A𝑖(𝑠) = S𝐶
𝑖
assigns a single admissible successor state to the
uncontained state. Consequently, the optimal action is trivial
and no Bellman recursion is required.
In contrast, when 𝑠∈S𝐶
𝑖, the admissible action set satisfies
A𝑖(𝑠) ⊆S𝐶
𝑖. In this case, the optimal value function is
computed via the Bellman optimality equation

V. STABILITY AND CONVERGENCE
In this section, we provide the proofs for the stablility and
converegence of the proposed decentralized coverage method.

y = vec

(22)
Assumption 2. For any 𝑠∈S𝑈
𝑖, the target set P𝑖is a triangle
strictly contained in the communication triangle T𝑖(𝑡) and
edge-aligned with T𝑖(𝑡).
Assumption 3. For any 𝑠∈S𝐶
𝑖, the target set P𝑖is a triangle
strictly contained in the target triangle induced by the optimal
next state 𝜋∗
𝑖(𝑠) and edge-aligned with it.
Theorem 1. Assume each agent 𝑏𝑖∈V \V0 satisfies the AOC
property and, in Assumption 1, the target set P𝑏𝑖is replaced
by the time-varying communication triangle T𝑏𝑖[𝑡]. Then the
coverage evolution satisfies
y[𝑡+1] = 𝚪[𝑡]y[𝑡],
(23)
where 𝚪[𝑡] is row-stochastic for all 𝑡. Consequently, (23)
defines a time-inhomogeneous Markov process.
Proof. For each anchored agent 𝑏𝑖∈V0, r𝑏𝑖[𝑡] = p𝑏𝑖for all
𝑡. For any 𝑏𝑖∈V \ V0, the AOC property and the transition
rules in Section IV-B imply
r𝑏𝑖[𝑡+1] =
∑︁
𝑏𝑗∈N(𝑏𝑖)
𝛼𝑏𝑖,𝑏𝑗[𝑡]r𝑏𝑗[𝑡],
𝛼𝑏𝑖,𝑏𝑗[𝑡] ≥0,
∑︁
𝑏𝑗∈N(𝑏𝑖)
𝛼𝑏𝑖,𝑏𝑗[𝑡] =1.
Stacking all agent positions yields (23) with entries
Γ𝑖, 𝑗[𝑡] =


1,
𝑏𝑖∈V0, 𝑖= 𝑗,
𝛼𝑏𝑖,𝑏𝑗[𝑡],
𝑏𝑖∈V \V0, 𝑏𝑗∈N (𝑏𝑖),
0,
otherwise.
Each row of 𝚪[𝑡] is nonnegative and sums to one; hence 𝚪[𝑡]
is row-stochastic.
Theorem 2. Consider y[𝑡+1] = 𝚪[𝑡]y[𝑡], where each 𝚪[𝑡] ∈
R𝑁×𝑁is row-stochastic. Let V0 denote anchored agents
satisfying r𝑏𝑖[𝑡] ≡p𝑏𝑖for all 𝑏𝑖∈V0 and all 𝑡. After reordering
agents, write
𝚪[𝑡] =

Assume there exist 𝑇≥1 and 𝜂∈(0,1) such that:
(C1) Assumptions 2–3 hold.
(C2) For every 𝑡and every follower index 𝑖,
∑︁
𝑗∈V0
 𝚪[𝑡+𝑇−1] ···𝚪[𝑡]
𝑖𝑗≥𝜂.
(25)
Then the follower subsystem
y𝐹[𝑡+1] = A[𝑡]y𝐹[𝑡] +B[𝑡]p
(26)
is globally exponentially stable: for all 𝑡≥𝑠,
∥𝚽(𝑡,𝑠)∥∞= ∥A[𝑡−1] ···A[𝑠]∥∞≤(1−𝜂)⌊𝑡−𝑠
𝑇⌋.
(27)


--- Page 7 ---
Fig. 4: The initial formation of the agent team and the
communication links.
Moreover, y𝐹[𝑡] converges, and each follower coordinate con-
verges to a convex combination of the anchors’ coordinates.
Proof. From (24) and anchor invariance, the follower dynam-
ics are (26). Row-stochasticity of 𝚪[𝑡] implies A[𝑡] ≥0 and
A[𝑡]1 ≤1, i.e., A[𝑡] is substochastic.
Define the 𝑇-step product

A𝑇[𝑡] =A[𝑡+𝑇−1] ···A[𝑡].

∑︁
𝑗∈V0
(M[𝑡])𝑖𝑗+
∑︁
ℓ
(A𝑇[𝑡])𝑖ℓ= 1.
By (C2), Í
𝑗∈V0(M[𝑡])𝑖𝑗≥𝜂, hence Í
ℓ(A𝑇[𝑡])𝑖ℓ≤1 −𝜂.
Therefore,
∥A𝑇[𝑡]∥∞= max
𝑖
∑︁
ℓ
(A𝑇[𝑡])𝑖ℓ≤1−𝜂.
(28)
Let 𝚽(𝑡,𝑠) = A[𝑡−1] ···A[𝑠]. Grouping the product into
blocks of length 𝑇and using submultiplicativity of ∥· ∥∞
with (28) gives (27), proving exponential contraction of the
homogeneous system.
Unrolling (26) yields
y𝐹[𝑡] = 𝚽(𝑡,0)y𝐹[0] +
𝑡−1
∑︁
𝜏=0
𝚽(𝑡,𝜏+1)B[𝜏]p.
Because rows of [B[𝑡] A[𝑡]] sum to 1, ∥B[𝑡]∥∞≤1, and
(27) implies ∥𝚽(𝑡,𝜏+ 1)∥∞decays geometrically, the series
converges; hence y𝐹[𝑡] converges.
Finally, each follower update is a convex combination of
neighbor states and fixed anchors, so each follower coordinate
remains in the convex hull of the anchors (and the shrinking
follower contribution), and the limit is a convex combination
of the anchors’ coordinates.
To establish asymptotic convergence, we introduce p𝑖as
the desired position of each agent 𝑖∈V, which is constant
when the target set D is stationary. The desired positions
p𝑖are known to all anchored agents 𝑖∈V0. In contrast, the
desired positions of follower agents 𝑖∈V \V0 are not locally
available to them. Nevertheless, the quantities p𝑖are used
solely as analytical constructs to characterize the decentralized
convergence of the follower dynamics.
Definition 4 (Desired communication triangle). For any agent
𝑏𝑖∈V \ V0, let N (𝑏𝑖) = {𝑏𝑖1,𝑏𝑖2,𝑏𝑖3} denote its in-neighbor

For 𝑙= 1, y0 = z0 is constant. Hence,
˜D𝑏𝑖= D𝑏𝑖and
˜𝑔𝑏𝑖= 𝑔𝑏𝑖∈S(𝑏𝑖) define fixed goal states for all 𝑏𝑖∈V1. By the
MDP framework in Section IV, each agent 𝑏𝑖∈V1 converges
to p𝑏𝑖, the center of 𝑔𝑏𝑖enclosing ˜h𝑏𝑖= h𝑏𝑖, implying y1 →z1.
Assume for some 𝑙≥2 that y𝑙−1 = z𝑙−1. Then, for all 𝑏𝑖∈V𝑙,
the data sets D𝑏𝑖[𝑡] →˜D𝑏𝑖and h𝑏𝑖[𝑡] →˜h𝑏𝑖, which implies
convergence of the associated goal states 𝑔𝑏𝑖→˜𝑔𝑏𝑖. Conse-
quently, 𝚪𝑙,ℎ[𝑡] →˜𝚪𝑙,ℎfor ℎ= 0,...,𝑙−1, and (42) yields
y𝑙[𝑡] →z𝑙. By induction, y𝑙[𝑡] →z𝑙for all 𝑙∈M \ {0}, and
therefore r𝑖[𝑡] →p𝑖for all 𝑖∈V \V0.
VI. SIMULATION RESULTS
We consider an 57-agent system with the initial configu-
ration shown in Fig. 4. Based on the reference formation,
V𝐵= {1,2,3,4} and 𝑏5 = 5 denote the boundary and core
agents, respectively, while all remaining agents are classified
as interior. The resulting inter-agent communication structure
is encoded by the DNN shown in Fig. 5 (arrows in Fig. 4),
constructed using the framework of Section III. It is desired
that the multi-agent system cover the triangular domain shown
in Fig. 6, where the environmental target data defined by D
are shown in green. The desired positions of the agent team,
denoted p1 through p57, are shown by black. To define the
state space, we choose 𝑀𝑖= 35, for every 𝑖∈V \ V0, which
in turn implies that
S𝐶
𝑖
 = 352 = 1225.
A. Evolution under Finite-Time Reachability of h𝑖
In this section, we assume that each agent 𝑖∈V \ V0 can
reach h𝑖[𝑡] in a single time step, which implies P𝑖= h𝑖[𝑡].
Under this assumption, the resulting agent paths are shown in
Fig. 7, where all agents 𝑖∈V asymptotically converge to their
desired positions p𝑖.
To further illustrate convergence, Figs. 8(a)–(b) show the
𝑥- and 𝑦-components of the actual and desired positions of
agent 29, r29[𝑡] and p29, respectively, as functions of discrete
time 𝑡. The trajectories demonstrate rapid convergence, with
r29[𝑡] reaching p29 in fewer than 40 time steps.

and desired positions of agent 29, illustrating convergence to

assumption and Assumption 3. All agents 𝑖∈V asymptotically

B. Evolution under AOC Assumption
In this section, we analyze the agents’ evolution under
Assumption 3, wherein the desired position p𝑖is constrained to
lie within an edge-aligned triangular region strictly contained
in T𝑖(𝑡), guaranteeing 𝜂= 0.05 for all 𝑖∈V \V0. Under this
condition, the resulting closed-loop trajectories of all agents in
the 𝑥–𝑦plane are shown in Fig. 9, demonstrating coordinated
motion and spatial containment. Moreover, Fig. 10 depicts the
temporal evolution of the 𝑥- and 𝑦-components of the desired
trajectory for agent 43, illustrating precise tracking behavior
over discrete time 𝑡.
VII. CONCLUSION
This paper presented a structured learning–based framework
for decentralized coordination and ground coverage in multi-
agent systems, in which inter-agent communication is encoded
through a geometrically induced deep neural network. By
exploiting the reference formation, agents are systematically
classified into boundary and interior groups, yielding a hierar-
chical communication architecture with explicitly constrained
and interpretable communication weights. These weights are
selected from finite sets and governed by a decentralized
Markov decision process, ensuring normalized interactions

and well-posed local decision making. Within this framework,
convergence of agent trajectories to desired goal configurations
associated with environmental target data was established
under AOC assumptions. Numerical simulations validate the
proposed policy-based decentralized coverage strategy and
demonstrate its ability to capture geometric structure and
achieve effective coverage of complex domains.
