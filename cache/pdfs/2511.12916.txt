Abstract
Power grid fault diagnosis is a critical process hindered by its re-
liance on manual, error-prone methods. Technicians must manually
extract reasoning logic from dense regulations and attempt to com-
bine it with tacit expert knowledge, which is inefficient, error-prone,
and lacks maintainability as ragulations are updated and experi-
ence evolves. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
promise in parsing unstructured text, no existing framework inte-
grates these two disparate knowledge sources into a single, verified,
and executable workflow. To bridge this gap, we propose Fault2Flow,
an LLM-based multi-agent system. Fault2Flow systematically: (1)
extracts and structures regulatory logic into PASTA-formatted fault
trees; (2) integrates expert knowledge via a human-in-the-loop in-
terface for verification; (3) optimizes the reasoning logic using a
novel AlphaEvolve module; and (4) synthesizes the final, verified
logic into an n8n-executable workflow. Experimental validation
on transformer fault diagnosis datasets confirms 100% topological
consistency and high semantic fidelity. Fault2Flow establishes a
reproducible path from fault analysis to operational automation,
substantially reducing expert workload.

Introduction
Power grid equipment fault diagnosis is a critical process that en-
sures the reliability and safety of power systems. When abnormal
conditions arise, such as transformer overheating, insulation fail-
ure or partial discharge, technicians must determine the root cause,
assess possible propagation paths, and choose appropriate miti-
gation actions. This diagnosis is typically guided by two discon-
nected knowledge sources: (1) Regulatory documents, which specify
standardized fault scenarios, safety requirements, and mandatory
handling procedures, and (2) Technicians’ experiential knowledge,
accumulated over years of on-site troubleshooting. Traditionally,
fault diagnosis relies heavily on manual interpretation of these
documents and expert experience. Engineers read through lengthy
regulations, extract conditional logic by hand, and encode fault-
handling rules into tools or checklists [4, 7]. This manual approach
suffers from three major drawbacks: it leads to incomplete knowl-
edge (as expert experience is hard to codify), poor maintainability,
and severe inefficiencies. For instance, any regulatory revision re-
quires engineers to manually find and update the corresponding
logic, a cumbersome process that can introduce new errors. Ad-
dressing these challenges demands resolving two core issues: first,
the automatic extraction of fault reasoning logic from unstructured
regulations, and second, the creation of user-friendly tools for the
efficient accumulation of experiential knowledge. Furthermore, these
two knowledge types must be structurally integrated and verified
to enhance both extraction accuracy and tool practicality.
Recent technological advancements lay a solid foundation for
tackling these problems. Large language models (LLMs) have en-
abled a new “knowledge + data dual-driven” paradigm, moving
beyond structured data. This allows them to parse semantic logic
directly from unstructured text, as demonstrated in fields from
healthcare [6, 10] to law [3]. Beyond simple extraction, related
work provides a basis for high-reliability reasoning. Generative AI
has been used to automate formal Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) [8], and

methods like Logic Augmented Generation (LAG) [2] use knowl-
edge graphs to ensure LLMs operate within strict logical boundaries.
Within the power grid domain itself, multi-agent architectures like
Grid-Agent [9] and GridMind [5] have proven effective for enhanc-
ing modularity and interpretability by decomposing complex tasks.
However, no existing system integrates these two knowledge
types (formal regulations and expert insights) or verifies them
within a single, automated workflow. To bridge this gap, we pro-
pose Fault2Flow, an LLM-based multi-agent system that addresses
this end-to-end challenge. Fault2Flow systematically (1) Extracts
and Structures Regulatory Logic, automatically parsing regulatory
documents and creating PASTA-formatted fault trees; (2) Integrates
Expert Knowledge through a human-in-the-loop interface for expert
review, refinement, and verification; (3) Optimizes Reasoning using
a novel AlphaEvolve module that refines fault tree structures; and
(4) Automates Execution, synthesizing the verified logic into an n8n-
executable workflow. Experimental validation on transformer fault
diagnosis datasets confirms 100% topological consistency, full reach-
ability coverage, and high semantic fidelity. By combining modular
agent cooperation with AlphaEvolve optimization, Fault2Flow sub-
stantially reduces expert workload and establishes a reproducible
path from fault analysis to operational automation.

Fault2Flow
Figure 1: Overall architecture of the Fault2Flow system
The overall architecture of Fault2Flow is illustrated in Figure 1.
It follows a decoupled front-end/back-end design: the front end pro-
vides interactive tools for domain experts, while the back end imple-
ments a multi-agent reasoning pipeline that automates fault-logic
extraction and workflow generation. At a high level, Fault2Flow
operates through three coordinated stages. (1) Document Under-
standing: regulatory PDFs are parsed and converted into structured
Markdown. (2) Knowledge Structuring: a sequence of LLM agents
transforms the Markdown into (i) mind maps, which organize con-
cepts, conditions, and decision rules into a hierarchical structure,
and (ii) fault trees, which formalize causal and logical relation-
ships in a machine-readable format. (3) Workflow Synthesis and
Verification: the structured representations are translated into n8n
workflow definitions, which are then automatically validated using
synthesized test cases to ensure correctness and consistency.

2.1
Frontend Design
Built on Vue3 and Element Plus, the front end provides a user-
friendly interface for document upload, mind map/fault tree edit-
ing, and workflow initiation. It integrates pdfjs-dist1 (PDF preview),
xlsx2 (table parsing), and ECharts3 (visualization) to support practi-
cal engineering use.
A key design principle is human-in-the-loop oversight. As shown
in Figure 1, domain experts can review intermediate outputs—mind
maps, fault trees, and workflow configurations—providing correc-
tions or refinement instructions when necessary. This mechanism
ensures that the multi-agent pipeline remains aligned with industry
standards and domain-specific requirements.
2.2
Backend Design
The backend, implemented in Python 3, handles PDF parsing, multi-
agent reasoning, structural optimization, and workflow genera-
tion. It uses MinerU4 for high-quality PDF extraction, converting
user-uploaded regulatory documents into structured Markdown.
The processed text is stored in MySQL for reliable structured data
management and indexing, while vector embeddings are stored
in Milvus5 to support semantic vector search and similarity-based
retrieval. This dual-storage design enables efficient document-level
access and semantic-level retrieval throughout the pipeline.
The multi-agent workflow consists of the following components:
PDF Extraction. MinerU is an open-source extractor designed to
process multi-modal PDFs containing text, tables, formulas, and im-
ages. It converts regulatory documents into Markdown, providing
clean, structured input for downstream reasoning tasks.
Mind Map Generation Agent. Taking the parsed Markdown as
input, the LLM is prompted via a one-shot example to produce
a PlantUML-formatted mind map that captures both qualitative

descriptions and quantitative decision criteria in the regulation [1].
Experts may then refine the mind map either by editing it directly
or by supplying additional instructions to the LLM.
Fault Tree Translation Agent. Once the mind map is validated,
it is used to guide an LLM-based translation step that converts its
quantitative logic into PASTA-formatted fault tree code. As with the
previous stage, experts can revise the output manually or through
corrective prompts. The leaf nodes of the PASTA fault tree form the
basis for determining workflow input parameters in later stages.
AlphaEvolve Optimization. To enhance structural coherence and
logical consistency in both mind maps and fault trees, Fault2Flow
incorporates the AlphaEvolve evolutionary optimizer6 . AlphaE-
volve employs a multi-island evolutionary strategy where multiple
subpopulations evolve independently while periodically exchang-
ing elite individuals. In each iteration, a parent program and several
“inspiration” programs are sampled from the elite archive and com-
posed into a joint prompt, prompting the LLM to generate improved
code. New candidates are evaluated for readability and logical va-
lidity; the strongest solutions replace weaker individuals, gradually
improving the structure over successive iterations (Figure ??).
Workflow Construction Agent. The construction module com-
bines LLM-based extraction with deterministic rule-based logic.
First, the PASTA code is parsed into a tree structure supporting
depth-first traversal. Next, each leaf node is processed by prompt-
ing the LLM to extract workflow input parameters according to
n8n trigger specifications. Using a post-order traversal strategy,
the system then generates and links n8n node configurations, and
finally invokes the n8n API to activate the executable workflow.
Workflow Verification Agent. To ensure correctness, the system
prompts the LLM to synthesize test samples and expected results
(indicating whether a fault should be triggered). These test cases
are automatically executed against the generated n8n workflow. If
outputs match expectations, verification succeeds. Otherwise, the
failure traces are fed back to the model to guide refinement and
regenerate the workflow. This iterative loop continues until suc-
cessful validation or reaching the maximum number of iterations.

Demonstration
To demonstrate the end-to-end capabilities of Fault2Flow, we con-
ducted a case study on transformer fault diagnosis. The source
material for this demonstration was the national standard “DL/T
722-2014: Guidelines for Dissolved Gas Analysis and Judgement of
Transformer Faults.” As shown in Figure 3, this case study show-
cases the full pipeline, from parsing the raw document to generating
a verified, executable workflow.
Data Upload and Parsing. The experiment focused on the “three-
ratio method” described in the standard for dissolved gas analysis
(DGA). The uploaded document was first processed by MinerU,
which automatically extracted the hierarchical text, diagnostic ta-
bles, and numerical thresholds. This step produced a structured
Markdown corpus, making the complex regulatory logic accessible
for the subsequent reasoning agents.
Mind Map and Fault-Tree Generation. The The Mind-Map Gen-
eration Agent then used this corpus to generate a PlantUML-formatted

ports to executable n8n workflow in three-ratio diagnostic.
mind map. This agent, using the Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct
model (at temperature = 0.0) in a one-shot configuration, pro-
duced an initial structure that was further refined by our AlphaE-
volve module. The resulting diagram accurately captured the full di-
agnostic hierarchy of the three-ratio method, including both quanti-
tative ratios (C2H2/C2H4, CH4/H2, C2H4/C2H6) and the correspond-
ing qualitative fault patterns (e.g., overheating, partial discharge,
arcing discharge).
After an expert reviewed and approved this mind map, the
Fault-Tree Translation Agent converted the PlantUML structure
into PASTA DSL. This step produced a machine-readable logical
tree where each quantitative threshold was modeled as a compo-
nent (e.g., C2H2/C2H4 < 0.1) and intermediate nodes represented
diagnostic gates (e.g., Low-temperature overheating < 150 °C). The
output successfully passed all PASTA self-checking procedures,
confirming its syntactic correctness and logical integrity.
Workflow Synthesis and Verification. Finally, the Workflow Con-
struction Agent traversed the verified PASTA code to automatically
synthesize an n8n executable workflow. It mapped each leaf node to
a corresponding n8n input form and transformed the logical gates
into conditional IF/ELSE branches. Subsequently, the Workflow
Verification Agent took over. It automatically generated synthetic
test data and expected outputs for each fault type, then executed
the workflow iteratively. This verification loop confirmed that all
diagnostic paths were reachable and that the workflow’s behavior
was semantically identical to the logic in the original PASTA model.
Overall, this case study demonstrates the capability of Fault2Flow
to bridge the gap from complex, domain-specific fault logic (in un-
structured text) to automated, verifiable operational workflows in
a real-world power grid scenario.

Evaluation
To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we con-
ducted a comprehensive evaluation across multiple LLMs focus-
ing on the workflow generation stage, which forms the core of the
fault-to-workflow transformation pipeline. All experiments were
conducted under identical inputs to ensure fair comparison.

Data. Our experiments used a transformer fault-diagnosis dataset
with 16 cases (9 via three-ratio method, 7 via characteristic gas
method). Each case includes an expert-designed fault tree (con-
verted to PASTA code by engineers), forming 16 test samples (two di-
agnostic categories) with PASTA representations and auto-generated
n8n workflows.
Evaluation Metrics. We designed four complementary metrics to
assess the system performance:
(1) Logical Readability and Maintainability (LRM): This
metric evaluates the interpretability and modular clarity of the
generated workflows. GPT-5 was employed to emulate expert eval-
uation, simulating engineers familiar with both PASTA and n8n.
The model scored the conversion results using a 5-point Likert scale
(1 = disorganized and unreadable; 5 = highly readable and mod-
ular). The final normalized LRM score represents the aggregated
assessment of logical clarity, hierarchical organization, and naming
consistency.
(2) Semantic Fidelity (SF): Semantic fidelity measures whether
the generated workflow fully preserves the logical semantics of the
original PASTA representation, including nested conditions and
exception handling. We employed GPT-5 to evaluate each workflow
by comparing its execution output with the expected diagnostic
reasoning, to identify semantic deviations. The score is normalized
to the range [0, 1], where 1 indicates perfect semantic consistency.
(3) Topological Consistency (TC): Topological consistency
measures the structural correspondence between the PASTA fault
tree and the generated n8n workflow. It is computed as:
𝑇𝐶= |𝐸𝑃𝐴𝑆𝑇𝐴∩𝐸𝑛8𝑛|
|𝐸𝑃𝐴𝑆𝑇𝐴|
,
(1)
where 𝐸𝑃𝐴𝑆𝑇𝐴and 𝐸𝑛8𝑛denote the directed edge sets of the PASTA
logic graph and n8n workflow graph. This metric reflects how
faithfully control and data flows are preserved during translation.
(4) End-to-End Reachability Coverage (E2ERC): This metric
evaluates whether all logical paths in the original PASTA model
remain executable in the generated workflow. It is defined as:
𝐸2𝐸𝑅𝐶= |P𝑐𝑜𝑣|
|P𝑟𝑒𝑓|,
(2)
where P𝑟𝑒𝑓is the set of valid paths in the original fault tree, and
P𝑐𝑜𝑣is the subset of reachable paths in the generated workflow. A
higher E2ERC means better coverage and functional completeness.
Results and Discussion. As shown in Table 1, the Fault2Flow
framework significantly outperforms end-to-end baseline models
that directly convert text into workflows, showing clear improve-
ments in TC, E2ERC, and overall success rate. In contrast, baseline
models exhibit incomplete topology mapping (TC < 0.94) and
lower reachability coverage (E2ERC < 0.72), further confirming
the necessity of the structured reasoning and verification mecha-
nisms integrated into the Fault2Flow. Moreover, models based on
the Fault2Flow framework consume only about one-tenth of the
computational resources required by end-to-end approaches.
