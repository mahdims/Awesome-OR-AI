ABSTRACT
Materials discovery requires navigating vast chemical and structural spaces
while satisfying multiple, often conflicting, objectives. We present LLM-guided
Evolution for MAterials design (LLEMA), a unified framework that couples
the scientific knowledge embedded in large language models with chemistry-
informed evolutionary rules and memory-based refinement. At each iteration, an
LLM proposes crystallographically specified candidates under explicit property
constraints; a surrogate-augmented oracle estimates physicochemical properties;
and a multi-objective scorer updates success/failure memories to guide subsequent
generations. Evaluated on 14 realistic tasks spanning electronics, energy, coatings,
optics, and aerospace, LLEMA discovers candidates that are chemically plausible,
thermodynamically stable, and property-aligned, achieving higher hit-rates and
stronger Pareto fronts than generative and LLM-only baselines. Ablation studies
confirm the importance of rule-guided generation, memory-based refinement, and
surrogate prediction. By enforcing synthesizability and multi-objective trade-offs,
LLEMA delivers a principled pathway to accelerate practical materials discovery.

INTRODUCTION
Materials discovery requires identifying or designing materials with properties tailored to a specific
task. However, the immense combinatorial space of chemical and structural compositions makes the
traditional discovery process resource-intensive and slow (Hautier et al., 2012; Davies et al., 2016).
While machine learning has accelerated the search for new materials, its reliance on large labeled
datasets limits performance in data-scarce regimes. Trained on vast text corpora including scientific
literature, Large language models (LLMs) offer a way to inject prior knowledge, making them
tools for scientific discovery even in data-scarce settings (White, 2023). Recently, LLMs have been
leveraged to bridge natural language and materials science, using textual knowledge to generate and
refine hypotheses (Jia et al., 2024; Sprueill et al., 2024; Ghafarollahi & Buehler, 2025; Kumbhar et al.,
2025). However, most existing methods rely on prompt engineering or unguided material generation,
often producing candidates that are theoretically plausible yet unstable or impractical to synthesize.
Moreover, they typically formulate material discovery as a single-objective task, optimizing for
one property (e.g., bandgap, stability, or conductivity) in isolation, whereas real-world materials
discovery is inherently multi-objective (see Figure 1), requiring trade-offs among competing targets
such as electrical conductivity and thermal resistance in thermoelectric materials (Hao et al., 2019).
To address these challenges, we propose LLM-guided Evolution for MAterial discovery (LLEMA),
a novel framework that uses LLM’s scientific knowledge with evolutionary search, and chemistry-
informed design principles to generate and refine candidates under multiple task-specific property
constraints. LLEMA introduces a range of chemistry-informed design principles as operators
for candidate generation and refinement. These principles encode core knowledge across the
entire materials discovery cycle, spanning compositional substitution, crystal structure manipulation,
phase stability, and property-specific conditions. Unlike prior baselines, this chemically grounded
generation integrates thermodynamic stability, enabling the systematic discovery of compounds that
are both novel and experimentally realizable. At each iteration, the LLM fuses pretrained chemical

Figure 1: Overview of our multi-objective material discovery benchmark. The benchmark spans six diverse
disciplines encompassing fourteen tasks with thermodynamic, electrical, physical, and chemical properties of
materials.
knowledge with domain rules to balance exploration of chemical space and exploitation of promising
leads. Candidates are expressed as crystallographic information files (CIFs) for downstream property
prediction (Figure 2B). Surrogate-assisted oracle models then estimate task-relevant physicochemical
properties (Figure 2C), and candidates are scored against both performance objectives and design
constraints. Successful and failed trajectories are fed back to the LLM (Figure 2D), enabling iterative
refinement of subsequent generations. Thus, LLEMA provides a principled framework for multi-
objective discovery by explicitly enforcing stability and synthesizability to generate compounds that
are not only novel but also physically realizable.
To evaluate LLEMA, we introduce a benchmark suite of 14 diverse, industrially critical discovery
tasks spanning wide-bandgap semiconductors, hard coatings, dielectrics, photovoltaics, and more
(Figure 1). Unlike prior work that optimizes a single property in isolation, our tasks capture
industrially relevant challenges that are inherently multi-objective.
For example, discovering
wide-bandgap semiconductors, a task critical for power and optoelectronic industries, requires
simultaneously optimizing band gap and formation energy, rather than targeting either property alone.
Such formulations reflect the reality of materials discovery, where progress hinges on balancing
multiple constraints at once. The suite covers problems that are experimentally demanding and
central to applications across electronics, energy, coatings, optics, and aerospace (Appendix B). By
combining chemistry-informed design with iterative LLM-guided evolution, LLEMA goes beyond
proposing candidates that are good at a single metric, instead generating plausible, synthesizable
materials that satisfy complex, real-world objectives.
We
evaluate
LLEMA
using
GPT-4o-mini
(OpenAI,
2023)
and
Mistral-Small-3.2-24B-Instruct-2506 (Jiang et al., 2024) as LLM backbones.
Our results demonstrate that LLEMA consistently discovers chemically valid and structurally
accurate candidates, with faster convergence across test settings. Our analysis further highlights
the crucial role of rule-guided generation, memory-based feedback, and surrogate-assisted property
prediction in LLEMA ’s performance. The major contributions of this work are as follows:
• A unified, synthesizability-aware framework. We propose LLEMA, which integrates the
scientific knowledge of LLMs with chemistry-informed evolutionary rules to generate candidates
that are both novel and chemically synthesizable.
• Memory-based evolutionary refinement. We design a feedback mechanism that leverages success
and failure pools, together with multi-island sampling, to iteratively steer LLM exploration toward
high-performing regions while avoiding memorization.
• Multi-objective discovery under realistic constraints.
We formulate materials design
as a constrained, multi-objective optimization problem and evaluate solutions via hit rate,
thermodynamic stability, and Pareto front analysis.
• Comprehensive evaluation across discovery tasks. We curate a benchmark suite of 14 industrially
relevant discovery tasks, and demonstrate that LLEMA consistently discovers thermodynamically
stable, chemically meaningful, and property-aligned candidates, outperforming prior baselines.

LLEMA METHOD
2.1
PROBLEM FORMULATION
We formulate the material discovery task T as an optimization problem over the chemical space,
where the goal is to identify the optimal material:
m∗= arg max
m∈M
f(m),
(1)
where m denotes a material from the valid candidate set M representing the chemical space, and
the function f : M →R is a black-box objective that assigns each material a scalar value to the
property of interest. However, in practice, material discovery rarely involves optimizing a single
property. Instead, materials must satisfy multiple property constraints C = {c1, c2, . . . , ck} while
jointly optimizing competing objectives f1, . . . , fn. Each constraint ci corresponds to a property
function fi : M →R and is satisfied when
ci : fi(m) ∈[li, ui]
or
ci : fi(m) ≥τi,
(2)
where li, ui, τi ∈R denote constraint-specific thresholds. The overall task thus reduces to identifying
candidates m ∈M that satisfy all constraints while achieving favorable trade-offs across objectives.
A naive strategy for multi-objective optimization is to aggregate objectives via a weighted sum:
m∗= arg max
m∈M
X
i
wi fi(m),
(3)
where wi denotes the weight of the i-th objective. This formulation captures the multi-objective
nature of material discovery, where competing property goals must be jointly optimized under
domain-specific constraints. The task, therefore, reduces to efficiently identifying candidate materials
that satisfy all property requirements while maximizing overall performance across objectives.
2.2
HYPOTHESIS GENERATION
As illustrated in Figure 2, LLEMA begins with material candidate generation, followed by
physicochemical property prediction, candidate evaluation, and evolutionary refinement. This
stage combines the generative capabilities of LLMs with domain-guided constraints to synthesize
chemically plausible hypotheses aligned with quantitative property targets. At each iteration n, the
LLM πθ samples a batch of b candidate materials Mb from the prompt pn. Appendix D.1, Figure 7
details the construction of this prompt, composed of four components:
3


--- Page 4 ---
• Task Specification: The task description contains the natural language discovery objective T
(e.g., “wide-bandgap semiconductors”) ensuring that candidate generation remains aligned with
the overarching goals of the task, while also encoding the property constraints C (e.g., band gap
≥2.5 eV, formation energy ≤−1.0 eV/atom) that distinguish valid from invalid designs.
• Chemistry-Informed Design Principles: After the initial generation (n = 0), the prompt
incorporates chemistry-informed design rules R (e.g., same-group elemental substitutions,
stoichiometry-preserving replacements).
These rules act as operators that encode domain
knowledge, guiding the search toward chemically meaningful regions of the space while maintaining
enough flexibility to allow for novel discoveries. Appendix D.2 details the evolution rules.
• Demonstrations: The population buffer Pn−1 maintains separate buffers to hold examples of
successful (M+) and failed (M−) candidates from prior iterations. Storing them in distinct buffers
makes it possible to supply balanced demonstrations in pn, providing the LLM with explicit in-
context feedback. This organization helps the model infer decision boundaries between promising
and invalid designs more effectively.
• Crystallographic Representation: For each proposed candidate Mj, the LLM outputs a
crystallographic configuration in structured JSON format, specifying the reduced chemical formula,
lattice parameters, atomic species, and fractional coordinates (Figure 2B). This standardized,
machine-readable representation enables direct downstream evaluation with the property-predictor
f, which predicts physicochemical properties and updates the population state.
2.3
PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTY PREDICTION
Following candidate generation, LLEMA estimates the physicochemical properties of the CIF
representation of each material using a hierarchical prediction system. For a given candidate Mj, the
workflow first queries the reference model, which retrieves property values from curated experimental
and computational databases like Materials Project (Jain et al., 2013) through exact or similarity-
based matching. For out-of-distribution candidates, which lie outside the coverage of this reference
model, LLEMA employs surrogate models such as CGCNN (Xie & Grossman, 2018) and ALIGNN
(Choudhary & DeCost, 2021) to provide predictions. This yields a property vector f(m) ∈Rd, where
each component corresponds to a physicochemical attribute of interest. The vector is subsequently
evaluated by a multi-objective scoring function against the design constraints C. Additional details on
the implementation of these surrogate models are provided in Appendix D.2.
2.4
FITNESS ASSESSMENT AND MEMORY MANAGEMENT
Candidates are evaluated using a multi-objective scoring function that measures the degree of
alignment between their predicted properties and the target design constraints C. For each candidate
material Mj generated at iteration n, the set of predicted properties is denoted by fi(Mj)k
i=1.
The composite score is then computed as: S(T , C; Mj) = Pk
i=1 wi · Φi(fi(Mj), ci); where wi
represents the relative importance of the i-th property, ci denotes the corresponding target constraint,
and Φi(·, ·) is a normalized reward function that quantifies satisfaction of the constraint ci by the
predicted value fi(Mj). Each candidate is then assigned to one of two memory pools: the success
pool M+, containing candidates that satisfy all hard constraints (i.e., Φi ≥0 for all i), and the
failure pool M−, containing candidates with negative composite scores. To progressively improve
candidate quality and guide the search toward property-compliant regions, LLEMA employs a
memory-based evolutionary refinement step inspired by island-model strategies (Romera-Paredes
et al., 2024; Shojaee et al., 2024; Abhyankar et al., 2025). The candidate population is divided into
m independent islands containing success (M+) and failure memory (M−), each initialized with a
copy of the initial exemplars. This structure supports parallel exploration, enabling different regions
of chemical space to evolve independently and explore a range of candidates. At each iteration n,
we first select one of the m islands using Boltzmann sampling (De La Maza & Tidor, 1992), with
a score-based probability of choosing a cluster i: Pi =
exp(si/τc)
P
i exp(si/τc), where si denotes the mean
score of the i-th cluster and τc is the temperature parameter. Within the chosen island, candidates are
sampled from memory to construct the next prompt pn+1. Specifically, top-k selection is applied
to M+ and M−to provide explicit demonstrations of high-scoring exemplars along with constraint
violations. This mixture of successful and failed candidates, combined with domain-specific evolution
rules R, forms the in-context examples that guide the LLM in generating new candidates.

As outlined in Algorithm 1, we initialize both the
population of materials P0 and the candidate pool
M that stores feasible solutions under the given
design constraints C. Subsequently, we construct
a prompt by combining the task description with
the associated physicochemical design constraints
for generating candidate materials.
At each
iteration n, top-k entries from prior iterations,
along with pre-defined evolution rules R (e.g.,
stoichiometry, oxidation state, substitution rules)
provided by domain scientists, are injected to
ensure chemical and structural validity while
exploring the candidate space. The LLM uses the
prompt to generate crystallographic information
file (CIF)–based material representations. These
candidates are then evaluated using an oracle
predictor
to
estimate
their
physicochemical
properties.
A scoring function assesses their
performance relative to the target design objectives,
partitioning candidates into success or failure pools
based on whether they satisfy the constraints. The
memory is updated accordingly, and a balanced
sampling from both success and failure trajectories
is used to provide feedback to the LLM, ensuring
both exploitation of high-performing regions and
exploration of underexplored design spaces. This
iterative loop continues for N rounds, after which the optimized candidate set M+ is returned.
2.5
IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
LLEMA is designed for seamless evaluation on new tasks and minimal engineering overhead. To
evaluate a new task, the user is only required to supply a CSV file specifying the task name and
associated property constraints. From this input, the agentic framework automatically and iteratively
constructs prompts to generate candidate materials, followed by their crystallographic structures
in CIF format using an LLM. Next, for property evaluation, LLEMA adopts a hierarchical oracle
strategy where the candidates are first queried against curated materials databases, while pretrained
ML surrogates (e.g., CGCNN, ALIGNN) are invoked only for out-of-distribution compounds. These
surrogates are used strictly in inference mode with publicly available pretrained weights, which
avoids retraining and significantly reduces computational overhead. For reproducibility, we report
all surrogate model checkpoints and APIs in Table 4 (Appendix D.2). Candidates violating hard
constraints are directly assigned low scores, ensuring efficient pruning before expensive evaluations.
This design enables scaling across tasks and large candidate spaces. A detailed implementation of
LLEMA is provided in Appendix D.1.

EXPERIMENTS
3.1
DATASETS AND BENCHMARKS
We evaluate LLEMA on fourteen application-driven discovery tasks spanning electronics, energy,
coatings, optics, and aerospace, to probe multi-objective reasoning under realistic constraints, and
thermodynamic stability (Table 1). Each task reflects an industrially relevant challenge and is designed
to probe multi-objective reasoning under realistic constraints. Our benchmark design follows three
guiding principles: (i) Application relevance: the target properties align with pressing technological
needs such as sustainable energy, advanced electronics, and structural resilience; (ii) Multi-constraint
optimization: tasks involve simultaneous optimization of multiple, often competing, objectives (e.g.,
maximizing hardness and conductivity), mirroring real-world engineering specifications; and (iii)
Thermodynamic stability: all tasks enforce stability requirements through formation energy and
energy-above-hull criteria to ensure synthetic accessibility rather than purely theoretical feasibility.
Appendix B contains additional details on all tasks, including property thresholds and predictive
models.

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
We assessed LLEMA using complementary evaluation criteria designed to capture both efficiency
and quality of material generation. Hit-Rate measures the percentage of generated candidates that
simultaneously satisfy all property constraints, quantifying the efficiency of valid discovery. Stability
evaluates the percentage of valid and thermodynamically stable, reflecting physical practicality
beyond theoretical feasibility. Specifically, materials having energy above hull value less than 0.1
eV/atom are considered stable. Finally, Pareto Front Analysis compares the quality of multi-
objective trade-offs, with superior methods producing non-dominated solutions that span larger and
more diverse regions of the design space. We benchmark LLEMA against generative models such as
CDVAE (Xie et al., 2021), G-SchNet (Gebauer et al., 2019), and DiffCSP (Jiao et al., 2023), as well
as LLM-driven approaches including LLMatDesign (Jia et al., 2024) and direct prompting baselines.
To ensure budget fairness, all non-LLM baselines (e.g., CDVAE, G-SchNet, DiffCSP) were allotted
10× more candidate generations (15, 000 vs. 1, 500) for LLM based methods to offset their lack
of in-context feedback and higher computational cost per sample. Unlike the baselines, LLEMA
refines its outputs by iteratively sampling candidates from its experience buffer through an in-context
refinement process. Detailed implementation settings for baselines are provided in Appendix C.
3.3
QUANTITATIVE RESULTS
Table 2 reports task-specific performance across fourteen benchmark domains, measured by hit
rate (H.R) and stability (Stab.) under varying physical and chemical constraints. Overall, LLEMA
consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving both higher hit rates and markedly better stability
across diverse material classes. Traditional generative models perform reasonably on simpler tasks
like wide-bandgap semiconductors or photovoltaic absorbers but often produce valid yet unstable
candidates. Even LLM-based baselines show limited robustness, performing well in some domains
but failing in others, suggesting poor generalization across different physical regimes. In contrast,
LLEMA consistently achieves the highest hit rate and markedly higher stability compared to the
baselines. This elevated stability indicates that evolutionary refinement and chemistry-informed rules
enable LLEMA to not only meet design constraints more reliably but also generate thermodynamically
consistent, physically meaningful structures.
Overall, these results demonstrate that LLEMA
generalizes robustly across material classes, combining exploration and constraint satisfaction more
effectively than prior methods. A deeper discussion on the qualitative aspects of LLEMA follows in
the upcoming sections.

QUALITATIVE RESULTS
We analyzed qualitative outcomes to understand LLEMA’s behavior under realistic discovery settings,
focusing on: (i) Convergence dynamics, which examine how iterative feedback progressively steers
the LLM toward feasible design regions; (ii) Pareto trade-offs, which assess whether the method
can balance competing objectives under strict property constraints; and (iii) Discovered candidates,
which illustrate how novel yet chemically plausible compositions emerge and how they align with
domain knowledge.

Convergence Toward Feasible Frontiers.
First,
we analyzed how solutions evolve over iterations.
Early generations scatter broadly across the search
space,
often violating property constraints or
collapsing into suboptimal regions. As the search
progresses, feedback from the oracle, evolutionary
memory, and constraint-based selection gradually
steer LLEMA toward more promising areas of the
chemical design space.
The proportion of valid
candidates increases from roughly 27% at the 250th
iteration to about 33% near the 1000th iteration,
indicating that the algorithm effectively exploits
high-fitness regions while maintaining exploration
across diverse chemical configurations. This gradual
improvement reflects stronger selection pressure
toward feasible trade-offs, resulting in a visible
migration of candidate clusters into constraint-
satisfying zones (e.g., band gaps above 2.5eV with
low formation energies). These convergence dynamics show how iterative, feedback-driven evolution
refines the LLM’s proposal distribution, preserving diversity while increasingly focusing on candidates
that balance multiple objectives in physically meaningful ways.
Pareto Tradeoff.
We then examined the Pareto fronts for the Wide-Bandgap Semiconductor and
Hard–Stiff Ceramic tasks, both of which impose stringent property requirements: semiconductors
must exhibit band gaps ≥2.5eV with formation energies ≤−1.0eV/atom to ensure functionality
and stability, while ceramics require bulk moduli in the range 100–300GPa and shear moduli between
60–200GPa. As shown in Figure 4, the optimal Pareto front is entirely dominated by LLEMA, with

all Pareto-optimal solutions originating from our method across both tasks. This demonstrates that
LLEMA not only generates a higher proportion of valid and thermodynamically stable candidates but
also consistently identifies the globally optimal trade-offs between competing objectives. By enforcing
explicit constraints and applying domain-guided evolutionary refinement, LLEMA effectively filters
infeasible solutions while converging toward the true Pareto-optimal frontier, surpassing all baseline
methods that fail to reach this region of the design space.
Discovered Candidates.
Finally, we evaluated the plausibility of discovered compositions in the
real world. We find that materials proposed by LLEMA align with families previously investigated
by domain experts, underscoring its ability to generate realistic candidates. For instance, in the
High-k dielectrics task, LLEMA suggests ZrAl2O5 and Hf0.5Zr0.5O2, which connect closely to Zr–Al
and Hf–Zr oxides studied as promising high-k materials (Hakala et al., 2006; Das & Jeon, 2020;
Islam et al., 2021). Similarly, LLEMA reflects expert strategies such as substitution and doping, e.g.,
proposing BaHfZr oxide, consistent with known dopant-driven improvements in HfZr oxides (Kim
et al., 2024). In photovoltaics, candidates such as CaZnSi and MgZnSi oxides emerge, which, while
not directly reported, are chemically related to established ZnO-based systems (Esgin et al., 2022).
These examples demonstrate that LLEMA not only respects constraints but also uncovers novel yet
chemically plausible families, validating its utility for guiding real-world discovery.

Figure 5: Percentage of generated candidates
from the Materials Project across four domains
for different baselines. Lower values indicate less
memorization.
A central challenge in leveraging large language
models (LLMs) for scientific discovery is their
tendency to memorize training data and regenerate
it during generation, rather than exploring novel
solutions.
Prior work has shown that LLMs
frequently reproduce examples from their training
corpus (Carlini et al., 2021; Hartmann et al.,
2023).
In materials discovery, this manifests as
repeated suggestions of compounds already present
in databases such as the Materials Project, leading
to high duplication rates and limited novelty. We
compare three approaches: a direct LLM call, an
LLM augmented with a memory buffer and iterative
feedback, and LLEMA. The direct LLM call exhibits
the highest duplication and near-total reliance on
the Materials Project (e.g., High-k dielectrics show
almost 100% overlap). While adding a memory buffer helps the model explore diverse leads, it
8


--- Page 9 ---
still shows a high rate of memorization, thus implying that simply storing past candidates does not
guide the search toward new or diverse regions of chemical space. In contrast, incorporating a multi-
island evolutionary framework enables the model to avoid local optima and repeated patterns. When
further combined with chemically informed rules such as oxidation-state consistency, stoichiometry
preservation, and prototype substitution, LLEMA effectively reduces redundancy and expands
exploration into novel, chemically plausible regions of the design space. Together, these components
push the model beyond corpus recall toward genuine discovery.

We
evaluate
the
benefits
of
evolutionary
refinement with domain-guided generation rules by
benchmarking LLEMA against two baselines: (i)
an LLM with iterative feedback (LLM w/ Memory),
and (ii) an unguided mutation–crossover search
implemented within a multi-island evolutionary
framework following Romera-Paredes et al. (2024).
All methods were run for 250 iterations across
four benchmark datasets, with property constraints
relaxed by 20% to allow broader exploration while
preserving task relevance. Results from Table 3 show that LLMs with iterative feedback yield
limited improvement, as the model tends to recall known materials and overfit to training patterns.
However, the introduction of multi-island evolution substantially improves hit rate and stability
by promoting parallel exploration and mitigating premature convergence, though the absence of
chemical constraints results in memorization. Incorporating chemistry-informed generation rules in
LLEMA achieves the best overall balance (H.R = 30.2, Stab. = 27.6, Mem. = 16.6), constraining
the search to thermodynamically and compositionally plausible regions while maintaining diversity.
This staged refinement from using memory to evolutionary search and domain-guided evolution
demonstrates how each component progressively enhances exploration, stability, and chemical
realism in generative materials design.

Figure 6 quantifies the effect of surrogate model–based
property prediction on LLEMA’s performance.
All
experiments were run for 250 iterations with task
constraints relaxed to encourage exploration, similar
to the Section 4.2. To isolate the contribution of ML-
based surrogates, we removed surrogate ML models like
CGCNN and ALIGNN, and restricted the workflow to
using only the Materials Project database for property
annotations. Furthermore, we experimented with fewer
iterations while relaxing task constraints for the wide-
bandgap semiconductors dataset. Even in this setting,
both hit rate and stability collapse to near-zero (< 5%),
as the evolutionary process cannot assign meaningful
rewards without surrogate models to candidates for
missing property annotations in the Materials Project
API. The search then drifts toward trivial or repeated compounds instead of progressing toward novel
solutions. By contrast, reintroducing surrogate predictors yields more than a sixfold improvement,
raising hit rate and stability into the 25–30% range. The surrogate estimates for out-of-distribution
candidates supply the evaluation signals needed to sustain exploration beyond the sparse coverage of
existing datasets. These results demonstrate that surrogate models are indispensable for furnishing
informative fitness signals under sparse supervision, preventing collapse, and enabling effective
discovery in incomplete material spaces.

RELATED WORK
Material Discovery.
Materials discovery has progressed from trial-and-error (Nagamatsu et al.,
2001) to ab initio modeling (Jain et al., 2011; Hautier et al., 2012; Pyzer-Knapp et al., 2015), with
DFT and high-throughput screening as standard tools. Machine learning further accelerates discovery
via rapid property prediction (Xie & Grossman, 2018; Chen et al., 2019; Choudhary & DeCost,
2021) and generative design (Gebauer et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2021; Jiao et al., 2023), including
multi-objective optimization (Gopakumar et al., 2018; Jablonka et al., 2021). Yet, these methods
remain limited by data scarcity and poor transferability across domains. In contrast, LLMs leverage
broad scientific knowledge for reasoning and hypothesis generation in data-poor regimes. Our work
integrates such knowledge-driven reasoning with predictive oracles and domain rules to advance
multi-objective materials synthesizability-aware materials design.
LLMs and Evolutionary Algorithms.
Recent advances in generative models have shown their
ability to generalize across diverse tasks using pre-trained knowledge and simple prompting
strategies (Brown et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2022). However, their outputs are often unreliable
or inconsistent (Madaan et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2023), motivating the use of evolutionary
optimization frameworks where LLMs act as generators and external evaluators guide selection
and refinement (Lange et al., 2024; Lehman et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2023). Such
frameworks have been successfully applied in areas including code and prompt generation (Guo
et al., 2023), mathematical optimization (Yang et al., 2024), program synthesis (Romera-Paredes
et al., 2024), robotics reward design (Ma et al., 2023), and chemical discovery (Wang et al., 2024).
We extend this line of work to real-world materials science challenges by incorporating chemistry-
informed LLM evolution that enforces structural validity and physical plausibility, enabling principled
discovery under multi-objective constraints.
LLMs in Material Science.
Early work applied LLM-based frameworks to literature mining,
named-entity recognition, and property extraction (Gupta et al., 2022; 2024; Niyongabo Rubungo
et al., 2025). Beyond text extraction, more recent methods use LLMs for hypothesis generation (Miret
& Krishnan, 2024), synthesis route planning, and as reasoning engines in multi-agent systems (Zhang
et al., 2024; Kang & Kim, 2024; Kumbhar et al., 2025). Systems such as MatAgent (Bazgir et al.,
2025) and LLMatDesign (Jia et al., 2024) further combine LLM reasoning with property predictors
and optimization loops. However, existing approaches often lack constraint enforcement, focus on
narrow single-objective tasks, and tend to collapse into unguided search, limiting the generation
of synthesizable, property-aligned candidates. LLEMA introduces an LLM-guided framework that
integrates reasoning-driven candidate generation with surrogate predictors, domain-guided rules,
and memory-based refinement, achieving a more effective balance between novelty, feasibility, and
multi-objective property alignment.

CONCLUSION
In this work, we present LLEMA, a unified framework that integrates the evolutionary paradigm,
domain-guided rules, and the scientific knowledge of LLMs to enable multi-objective and
synthesizability-aware materials discovery. To rigorously evaluate generality, we curate a benchmark
suite of 14 diverse, real-world discovery tasks spanning electronics, energy, coatings, optics, and
aerospace. Our experiments demonstrate three key findings: (i) LLEMA achieves higher hit rates
and stronger Pareto fronts than generative and LLM-only baselines, showing improved ability to
balance competing design objectives. (ii) LLEMA produces a larger fraction of thermodynamically
stable and chemically plausible compounds, validating its emphasis on synthesizability. (iii) LLEMA
significantly reduces duplication and corpus recall, mitigating the memorization tendency of vanilla
LLM generation and enabling genuine exploration of novel chemical space. While these results
highlight the potential of LLEMA, our reliance on surrogate predictors, limited experimental
validation, and the cost of iterative LLM queries suggest opportunities for future work paving
the way toward scalable and reliable automated materials discovery.

AUTONOMOUS MATERIALS DISCOVERY
The discovery of novel materials with tailored properties is fundamental to technological progress,
contributing to a global materials industry generating approximately $ 8 trillion in revenue in 2023
(McKinsey, 2024). The impact of tailored materials is particularly significant in critical domains
such as energy storage Ling (2022), photovoltaics Solak & Irmak (2023), and microelectronics
Refai-Ahmed et al. (2024), where advanced materials can enhance efficiency, reduce energy footprint,
and improve sustainability. The grand challenge in materials discovery lies in navigating an enormous
design space encompassing a vast number of material compositions and manufacturing techniques
while achieving the target material structures and properties across multiple length and time scales
(Oganov et al., 2019). Human intuition-based methods, along with traditional design of experiments
and computational investigations, are slow and ineffective at screening this vast space of possible
materials and synthesis conditions.
Consequently, the field has witnessed a rapid emergence
of data-driven discovery paradigms Agrawal & Choudhary (2016) and autonomous self-driving
laboratories Abolhasani & Kumacheva (2023), integrating artificial intelligence, robotics, and high-
throughput computation. Data-centric platforms such as the Materials Project (Jain et al., 2013)
exemplify this shift, offering open high-throughput DFT databases that enable large-scale screening of
candidate materials (Horton et al., 2025). Agent-based frameworks further advance this paradigm by
autonomously navigating complex chemical spaces and identifying novel stable compounds (Montoya
et al., 2020). Together, these systems mark a paradigm shift, transforming materials discovery from a
process of human-guided trial and error to one of algorithmic intuition and autonomous exploration.
B
DATASETS AND BENCHMARK
To evaluate multi-objective material discovery, we curate a diverse benchmark spanning 14
representative design tasks across various domains. Each task defines a distinct combination of
physicochemical constraints that reflect practical design objectives in real-world materials engineering.
Together, the benchmark captures the breadth of challenges faced in materials design, from optimizing
performance–stability trade-offs to balancing mechanical, dielectric, and sustainability objectives.
The resulting dataset assesses how well models can reason over complex, interdependent physical
properties and generate synthesizable candidates under realistic constraints.
Wide-Bandgap Semiconductors.
Wide-bandgap semiconductors underpin high-power and high-
frequency electronics, as well as optoelectronic applications like UV LEDs. Candidate materials
must achieve a band gap ≥2.5eV while maintaining formation energies ≤−1.0eV/atom and low
energy-above-hull (≤0.1eV/atom) to ensure both performance and stability. This task challenges
models to jointly balance wide electronic gaps with realistic thermodynamic feasibility, a combination
critical for next-generation power electronics and photonics.
SAW/BAW Acoustic Substrates.
Acoustic substrates are critical for wireless communication
devices, including filters and resonators. Target materials must combine shear moduli between
25–150GPa with dielectric constants between 3.7–95, ensuring mechanical resonance with stable
dielectric response. This task probes the ability to navigate trade-offs in mechanical and dielectric
behavior to identify candidates for next-generation 5G/6G communication technologies.
High-k Dielectrics.
High-permittivity dielectrics enable miniaturization in capacitors and gate
oxides for semiconductor technology. Desired materials exhibit dielectric constants between 10–90
and band gaps in the range 2.5–6.5eV, ensuring both capacitance density and insulation. The task
forces models to balance polarizability against leakage resistance, reflecting practical design needs in
integrated circuits.
Solid-State Electrolytes.
Solid electrolytes promise safe, high-energy batteries by replacing
flammable liquid electrolytes. Candidates must be thermodynamically stable (formation energy
≤−1.0eV/atom, energy above hull ≤0.1eV/atom), electronically insulating (band gap ≥2.0eV),
and contain mobile species such as Li, Na, K, Mg, Ca, or Al. This task reflects the fundamental trade-
off between chemical stability and ionic conductivity, which is central to enabling next-generation
solid-state batteries.
15


--- Page 16 ---
Piezo Energy Harvesters.
Energy-harvesting applications demand strong electromechanical
coupling and dielectric robustness. Candidates must have piezoelectric coefficients dij ≥8pC/N
and dielectric constants in the range 10 ≤κ ≤8000. Performance is often ranked by the figure of
merit d2/κ, which rewards high piezoelectric activity while penalizing excessive dielectric loading.
This task reflects the practical requirement of optimizing efficiency under electrical and mechanical
constraints in self-powered devices.
Transparent Conductors.
Transparent conducting oxides balance optical transparency with
electronic conductivity for use in displays and photovoltaics. Candidates must exhibit band gaps
Eg > 3.0eV and conductivities 50 ≤σ ≤5000S/cm while remaining thermodynamically stable.
This dual optimization captures the key trade-off between light transmission and carrier mobility.
Electrically Insulating Dielectrics.
Insulating dielectrics are critical for high-voltage applications
requiring minimal current leakage. Materials must have band gaps Eg ≥2.5eV and dielectric
constants κ ≥8.0, ensuring high breakdown strength and stable polarization response. These
constraints emphasize materials with strong insulation behavior and mechanical integrity under
electric fields.
Photovoltaic Absorbers.
Photovoltaic materials must absorb sunlight efficiently while remaining
stable, earth-abundant, and non-toxic. Target absorbers have optimal band gaps (1.1–1.6eV) for solar
conversion, formation energies ≤−0.5eV/atom, and must exclude rare or hazardous elements. This
task reflects real-world sustainability constraints, forcing models to move beyond theoretical optima
and identify candidates suitable for large-scale, affordable solar deployment.
Hard Coating Materials.
Coatings protect industrial components from wear, corrosion, and high
temperatures. Desired materials exhibit high bulk modulus (≥200GPa), wide band gaps (≥3.0eV),
and strong thermodynamic stability (formation energy ≤−1.0eV/atom). This task probes the ability
of models to discover coatings that simultaneously resist deformation, provide electrical insulation,
and remain synthesizable which is key for aerospace, tooling, and cutting-edge manufacturing.
Hard, Stiff Ceramics.
Ceramics used in extreme environments require resistance to deformation
while maintaining stiffness across broad ranges. Candidates must exhibit bulk moduli between
100–300GPa and shear moduli between 60–200GPa. This task emphasizes the discovery of brittle
but strong materials, essential for armor, cutting tools, and high-temperature structural applications.
Structural Materials for Aerospace.
Aerospace materials must balance light weight with
mechanical resilience. This task enforces minimum stiffness (bulk modulus ≥100GPa, shear
modulus ≥40GPa), low density (≤5.0g/cm3), and sufficient thermodynamic stability (energy above
hull ≤5.0eV/atom). It challenges models to identify materials that achieve high strength-to-weight
ratios while remaining manufacturable, crucial for aviation and spaceflight.
Acousto-Optic Hybrids.
Materials for acousto-optic devices must balance piezoelectric and
dielectric properties to minimize loading while enabling efficient coupling. Candidates are required
to exhibit piezoelectric coefficients in the range 2 ≤dij ≤9pC/N and dielectric constants in the
range 8 ≤κ ≤95, with a preference for a narrow κ band to reduce dielectric loading. Ranking
emphasizes proximity to target d-bands and mid-range κ values, highlighting the trade-off between
acoustic response and dielectric stability.
Low-Density Structural Materials.
Aerospace-grade materials must combine low density with
high stiffness-to-weight ratios. Candidates are constrained to density ρ ≤3.5g/cm3 and shear
modulus 65 ≤G ≤195GPa, with optimization targeting the ratio G/ρ. The task favors lightweight
systems that maintain strength and creep resistance under thermal stress.
Toxic-Free Perovskite Oxides.
Environmentally safe perovskite oxides aim to eliminate toxic
elements while preserving desirable optoelectronic properties. Candidates must have band gaps
Eg ≥2.0eV and bulk moduli 90 ≤K ≤135GPa, while excluding Pb, Cd, Hg, Tl, Be, As, Sb, Se,
U, and Th. The search prioritizes thermodynamically stable ABO3 structures that retain mechanical
durability without compromising sustainability.

BASELINES
We compare LLEMA against several state-of-the-art materials discovery baselines, encompassing a
diverse range of methodologies from traditional deep learning-based techniques to LLM-based
methods.
For all baselines, we generate candidate materials using their respective official
implementations, applying minimal benchmark-specific modifications when necessary. Property
values for all generated candidates are computed using the same property prediction pipeline as
employed in LLEMA, ensuring a consistent and fair comparison. Specifically, we implement:
CDVAE.
CDVAE (Xie et al., 2021) is a conditional variational autoencoder tailored for crystal
structure generation.
It learns latent representations of crystals conditioned on composition,
enabling the generation of valid and diverse candidate structures. We implement CDVAE using
the official open-source repository1 with default parameters, outputting the generated structures in
CIF (Crystallographic Information File) format, along with latent embeddings stored as NumPy
arrays for downstream analysis.
G-SchNet.
G-SchNet (Gebauer et al., 2019) is a graph-based deep generative model for molecular
and crystal structures, built on the SchNet architecture. It incrementally generates atom types and
positions conditioned on the partially built structure, allowing it to capture geometric and chemical
validity. We implement G-SchNet using the open-source codebase2 with default hyperparameters for
10000 iterations. The generated samples are stored in a database, which is subsequently converted
into candidate-specific CIF files.
DiffCSP.
DiffCSP (Jiao et al., 2023) introduces diffusion models for crystal structure prediction
(CSP). It models the distribution over atomic positions and lattice parameters via a denoising
diffusion probabilistic model, enabling efficient sampling of realistic crystal structures. We implement
DiffCSP using the official code release3 with default settings and store the generated candidates in
CIF files.
End2end.
We implemented a GPT-4o-mini to generate candidates conditioned on the design
task and its corresponding property constraints. The LLM operated with a sampling temperature of
τ = 0.8 to promote diversity while preserving structural coherence. It was explicitly instructed to
output candidates in Crystallographic Information File (CIF) format, ensuring standardized structural
representations suitable for subsequent validation and property evaluation using the surrogate-assisted
oracle prediction.
LLMatDesign.
LLMatDesign (Jia et al., 2024) leverages LLMs for material design by prompting
LLMs iteratively improve the provided material to return the material with the single target property.
As LLMatDesign is primarily designed for single-objective optimization, we adapt its released
implementation4 for our multi-objective materials discovery benchmarks. For candidate generation,
we adopt their original prompt template, which provides a material’s chemical formula and task-
specific properties and asks the model to propose a modification that satisfies the constraints. The
model selects one of four modification types—exchange, substitute, remove, or add—and outputs
both the modification and a natural-language hypothesis justifying the change.

Figure 7 illustrates an example prompt for the Wide-Bandgap Semiconductor
task. The prompt begins with general instructions specifying the LLM’s role and objective, followed
by task-specific details such as the description of the design problem, property constraints (e.g.,
required band gap and formation energy), and a set of previously explored candidates with their

associated property values sampled from the experience buffer. We then sample b = 2 candidate
outputs at a temperature of τ = 0.8, chosen to balance creativity with adherence to constraints
while exploiting promising directions in the search space. To further ensure physical plausibility,
we introduce rule-based constraints during the evolutionary phase (after the initial generation step,
n = 0), which guide the LLM through the material discovery cycle and promote chemically valid
candidates. By providing task descriptions, prior evaluations, and rule-based constraints in the prompt,
we effectively steer the LLM toward feasible, property-aligned material candidates.
Crystallographic Representation.
For each sampled compound, we generate a crystallographic
representation in the form of a CIF (Crystallographic Information File) (see Figure 7). A CIF encodes
the lattice parameters, symmetry, and atomic positions of a material, which directly determine key
properties such as band gap, formation energy, and stability. Oracle models require this structure-
aware representation to correctly predict thermodynamic and electronic properties, making CIF
generation essential for evaluating whether candidates are both physically plausible and functionally
relevant. By mapping each candidate to a valid crystallographic structure, LLEMA enables property
prediction and aligns with standard materials discovery workflows.
Data-Driven Evaluation.
We rely on oracle-assisted surrogate models to return key property
values such as band gap and formation energy, which serve as the basis for evaluating each candidate.
The predictions are used to assess whether generated materials satisfy the task-specific constraints.
Candidates that fully meet the constraints are scored highest, while those that partially satisfy them
are ranked above those that fail entirely. This data-driven evaluation ensures that generation quality
is grounded in quantitative property predictions rather than heuristic filtering, making it a critical
component of the discovery pipeline.
Here are a few design rules for generating new compounds:
- Same-group elemental substitution: Replace from the same periodic 
group.
- Stoichiometry-preserving substitution: Use chemically similar 
elements.

CIF Generation

Experience Management.
We adopt an island-based evolutionary strategy (Romera-Paredes et al.,
2024; Shojaee et al., 2024; Abhyankar et al., 2025) to manage the experience buffer, where generated
material candidates and their evaluation scores are distributed across m = 5 independently evolving
islands. Each island is initialized with a small set of seed candidates sampled from the Materials
Project API and refined using the LLM. Within each island, the buffer is divided into two components:
a reward buffer, which stores candidates that fully satisfy all task-specific constraints (e.g., band
18


--- Page 19 ---
gap and formation energy), and an error buffer, which stores candidates that only partially satisfy or
completely violate the constraints. This separation enables the framework to reinforce high-quality
generations while also retaining failure cases, which serve as negative examples to guide exploration.
The experience buffer is further leveraged to construct prompts for subsequent LLM calls. After the
prompt template is updated with task-specific information, one of the m islands is selected at random,
and k = 2 candidates are sampled from its buffers to serve as in-context demonstrations. Candidate
selection follows a Boltzmann strategy (De La Maza & Tidor, 1992) that assigns higher probability
to clusters with stronger evaluation scores. Specifically, if si denotes the score of the i-th cluster, the
probability Pi of selecting it is given by:
Pi =
exp(si/τc)
P
i exp(si/τc),
τc = T0

1 −u mod N
N

,
where τc is the temperature parameter, u is the current number of candidates on the island, and
T0 = 0.1 and N = 10,000 are hyperparameters. Once a cluster is selected, we sample candidates
from it for inclusion in the next generation.
This mechanism integrates information from both successful and failed generations while preserving
diversity across islands, thereby guiding the LLM toward more effective material discovery.
D.2
ADDITIONAL DETAILS
Surrogate Model.
The oracle in LLEMA is designed to provide scalable and reliable property
estimation by combining external databases with pretrained surrogates.
After generating
crystallographic representations (CIFs) for each candidate, we first query the Materials Project
API5 to retrieve available properties. However, the API has limited coverage: many target properties
such as electrical conductivity and dielectric constants are either missing for several materials or
absent altogether, and the database itself, though large, cannot cover all generated candidates. To
overcome this limitation, we conducted preliminary experiments with several pretrained models
and identified ALIGNN (Choudhary & DeCost, 2021) and CGCNN (Xie & Grossman, 2018) as
the most reliable surrogates across key properties. We use ALIGNN checkpoints trained on the
JARVIS-DFT dataset6 via their official implementation7 and the official CGCNN release8. This
design ensures a clear mapping: when properties are available in the Materials Project, we use them
directly; when they are not, the most appropriate surrogate model is selected based on our prior
experimentation. By integrating database queries with pretrained ML predictors, the oracle balances
accuracy, scalability, and coverage, enabling consistent evaluation across all discovery tasks. Table 4
provides a mapping between the surrogate models and the source pretrained files used to predict the
corresponding physicochemical properties.
Fitness Assessment.
LLEMA uses a multi-objective scoring function to assign scores to the
proposed candidates to guide the evolution process. The multi-objective scoring function in LLEMA
is defined as:
S(T , C; Mj) =
k
X
i=1
wi · Φi(fi(Mj), ci),
where fi(Mj) denotes the predicted value of the i-th property for candidate Mj, and ci is the
corresponding design constraint. The function Φi(·, ·) quantifies the degree of satisfaction between
the predicted property and its target constraint, normalized to a bounded reward space. The weighting
coefficients wi encode the task-specific importance of each property, allowing LLEMA to balance
competing objectives during optimization. However, for simplicity, we assign equal weights to all
the properties associated with a task. For example, in the wide-bandgap semiconductor task, band
gap and formation energy are given equal priorities, while energy-above-hull are included with lower
but non-zero weights to ensure stability and synthesizability. Material constraints are typically of
three types with better materials being higher the value being better, or lower the value being better.

for example in a wide-bandgap semiconductors, band gap is supposed to be higher than 2.5eV
whereas for formation energy, it is better to have lower values i.e. less than −1eV/atom. Similarly,
there are value or range based constraints Across all tasks, these weights are curated in consultation
with domain heuristics: performance-critical properties are emphasized, while feasibility constraints
(formation energy, density, hull stability) act as secondary filters to prevent chemically implausible
candidates. This principled weighting ensures that multi-objective optimization reflects the physical
and industrial priorities of each benchmark task, rather than being tuned arbitrarily.
Evolutionary Generation Rules.
To constrain exploration and ensure chemical validity, LLEMA
incorporates a set of domain-informed rules that guide the modification of candidate materials during
evolutionary refinement. These rules encode chemical heuristics such as group-wise substitutions,
prototype preservation, and functional analog discovery. At each iteration, they are injected into the
prompt as part of the evolutionary context, ensuring that candidate modifications follow chemically
plausible pathways while maintaining diversity. Below, we enumerate the rules used in this work.
Each rule is presented in monospaced format to emphasize its role as a design heuristic.

QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS
E.1
CASE STUDY
To better understand how LLEMA’s evolutionary mechanism balances exploration and exploitation,
we analyze the temporal dynamics of the search process across iterations. This case study focuses
on three aspects of the evolutionary trajectory: (i) memorization rate the proportion of generated
compounds retrieved directly from known databases such as the Materials Project; (ii) chemical
diversity the spread of elemental coverage across the periodic table; and (iii) validity progression
the fraction of syntactically and physically valid compounds discovered over successive generations.

From Memorization to Exploration.
In the
early stages of optimization, LLEMA’s search
behavior is dominated by memorization, with
a substantial portion of generated candidates
overlapping with known entries from the
Materials Project (Figure 8).
As the search
evolves, the proportion of externally sourced
structures rapidly declines. From about 83%
initially, the overlap with Materials Project
drops to 10% by 250 iterations, eventually
dropping to about 3% by the end of the
evolution. This steady decrease highlights a
clear transition from memorization of existing
chemical knowledge to exploration of novel
compositions. By later iterations, the candidate
pool is largely composed of previously unseen
structures, indicating that the model has shifted
from recall-driven synthesis toward genuine
materials discovery.
Convergence Toward Feasible Frontiers.
Tracking candidates in property space reveals how
LLEMA’s population progressively migrates toward feasible and optimal regions over time. As shown
in Figure 9, at early stages stages (Iteration 250), only about 30% of SAW/BAW acoustic substrates
satisfy physical validity constraints, with most scattering across thermodynamically unstable or
suboptimal zones. As the evolution proceeds, this fraction increases to nearly 46% by iteration 1000,
reflecting the growing influence of rule-based chemical filters and adaptive feedback mechanisms.
Concurrently, the Pareto front advances steadily, expanding the achievable trade-off frontier and
uncovering materials that balance multiple performance criteria. This improvement stems from
LLEMA’s evolutionary refinement process, where chemically guided mutations, crossover between
promising candidates, and memory-based selection pressure iteratively prune the search space. The
result is a guided transition from memorized priors to data-driven innovation, leading to denser
clusters of thermodynamically stable, property-aligned materials and a measurable improvement in
both diversity and discovery quality across generations.

Figure 10: Evolution of periodic table coverage during SAW/BAW acoustic substrate optimization. Each panel
shows the element-wise usage ratio across iterations (250, 500, 750, 1000) in the evolutionary search process.
Increasing Validity and Structural Fidelity.
As memorization declines, the fraction of valid
and physically plausible candidates rises steadily. Early populations contain roughly 30% valid
materials—many of which are simple substitutions of known prototypes—while later generations
surpass 80% validity. This improvement results from the combined effect of oracle-guided scoring and
constraint-aware feedback that prune chemically inconsistent structures while reinforcing successful
design patterns. The process simultaneously expands the search’s coverage of the periodic table: early
iterations are dominated by light elements and common oxides, whereas later generations incorporate
diverse transition metals, alkaline earths, and rare-earth substitutions, reflecting a richer exploration
of the underlying chemical landscape.
E.2
DIVERSITY OF IDENTIFIED MATERIALS
To assess the chemical diversity introduced by LLEMA, we compared the elemental distributions of
generated materials against those proposed by the baseline GPT-4o-mini across four representative
discovery tasks: photovoltaic absorbers, hard stiff ceramics, high-k dielectrics, and wide-bandgap
semiconductors (Figures 11–14). Each heatmap illustrates the normalized ratio of element occurrences
aggregated over 250 LLM-guided iterations. Across all tasks, LLEMA consistently expands the
explored chemical space, incorporating a broader range of metallic, semiconducting, and nonmetallic
elements compared to the baseline. For instance, in the hard ceramic and high-k dielectric tasks
(Figures 12–13), LLEMA identifies richer combinations of transition metals and oxygen-rich
compositions—key building blocks for mechanically and electronically robust materials. Similarly,
for wide-bandgap semiconductors (Figure 14), LLEMA diversifies the generated candidates beyond
conventional group III–V and II–VI chemistries. These results highlight how the integration of
memory-based refinement and chemistry-informed evolutionary rules enables LLEMA to navigate
and exploit underexplored regions of chemical space, thereby enhancing both diversity and relevance
in LLM-driven materials discovery.
