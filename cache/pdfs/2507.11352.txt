Abstract
Logistics operators – from battlefield coordinators re-routing airlifts ahead of a storm to ware-
house managers juggling late trucks – need to make mission-critical decisions. Prevailing methods
for logistics planning such as integer programming yield plans that satisfy user-defined logical
constraints, assuming an idealized mathematical model of the environment. On the other hand,
foundation models lower the intermediate processing barrier by translating natural-language user
utterances into executable plans, yet they remain prone to misinterpretations and hallucinations
that jeopardize safety and cost. We introduce a Vision–Language Logistics (VLL) agent, built on a
neurosymbolic framework that pairs the accessibility of natural-language dialogue with verifiable
guarantees on user-objective interpretation. The agent interprets user requests and converts them
into structured planning specifications, quantifies the uncertainty of the interpretation, and invokes
an interactive clarification loop when the uncertainty exceeds an adaptive threshold. Drawing on a
lightweight airlift logistics planning use case as an illustrative case study, we highlight a practical
path toward certifiable and user-aligned decision-making for complex logistics. Our lightweight
model, fine-tuned on just 100 training samples, surpasses the zero-shot performance of 20x larger
models in logistic planning tasks while cutting inference latency by nearly 50%. Our code and
video demonstrations are available at here.

1. Introduction
Toward Conversational, Certifiable Logistics. From humanitarian air-lifts that must beat incom-
ing storms to e-commerce warehousing that re-optimizes routes every minute, modern logistics is
increasingly a race against time, uncertainty, and domain complexity ( ¨Ozdamar et al., 2004; Ghiani
et al., 2004). Operators juggle heterogeneous data—live satellite imagery, weather forecasts, inven-
tory databases, and a lattice of hard constraints on safety, cost, and regulation. Today, interacting
with these systems demands fluency in specialized planning languages and manual cross-checks,
leaving non-experts on the sidelines and slowing even seasoned professionals when crises strike
(Nicoletti and Appolloni, 2024, 2025). This challenge motivates growing interest in more accessi-
ble, conversational interfaces for logistics planning.
We develop Vision–Language-Logistics (VLL) agents: multimodal AI co-pilots that can (i) under-
stand rich, free-form instructions; (ii) ground those instructions in real-time perceptual data; (iii)
synthesize and visualize executable plans through tight neurosymbolic integration; and (iv) prove

to the user, via explicit uncertainty signals and formal checks, that the inferred goals (i.e., user ob-
jectives) align with the user’s true intent. VLL agents build on parallel advances in vision–language
modeling, uncertainty estimation, and neurosymbolic verification, situating these techniques within
the emerging landscape of conversational, certifiable logistics systems.
A VLL agent is a closed perception–reasoning–action loop. At the perception stage, vision models
extract salient entities (e.g., damaged runways or congested highways) that ground the referents
in a natural-language command. A language model then translates the grounded request into a
structured goal specification (e.g., PDDL or SQL) that downstream planners can solve. Finally, a
symbolic verifier or constraint solver confirms feasibility and compliance, returning either a certified
plan or a targeted clarification query. This architecture, depicted in Figure 1, enables conversational
replanning at the cadence of operational tempo, i.e., users can issue follow-up directives, receive
intermediate analyses, and iterate until the plan is both satisfactory and formally sound. In short,
VLL agents promise accessibility without sacrificing reliability.
A Key Component: Uncertainty-Aware Intent–Verification. Among the many moving parts
of a VLL agent, we concentrate on a critical yet often underserved component: measuring and
reducing the uncertainty in goal classification. Standard LLM/VLM pipelines silently commit to
their first parse of a request; if that parse is wrong, downstream optimizers will dutifully compute
an optimal solution to the wrong problem. The VLL agent augments its VLM backbone with a
probabilistic field-level uncertainty estimator. Whenever the estimated uncertainty value in any
essential slot—e.g., destination airbase or delivery deadline—falls below an adaptive threshold, the
agent pauses, asks a pointed follow-up question, and only proceeds once uncertainty is resolved.
Technically, the verification loop maps user goals to a learned latent space, where different goal
types form distinct clusters. Building on the latent space, we introduce a Probabilistic Guarantee: a
theoretical lower bound of correct goal classification measured via the distance from a new input’s
latent vector to the nearest cluster centroid. Samples with high guarantee indicate low uncertainty.
These low-uncertainty traces feed a contrastive self-training loop that steadily sharpens the VLL
agent’s goal classification ability, allowing it (using the GPT-4o-mini backbone) to outperform a
20x larger GPT-4.1 model on goal-match accuracy while halving inference latency.

Contributions.
We (i) introduce the VLL agents as a neurosymbolic framework for conversational
logistics planning, (ii) propose an uncertainty-aware intent–verification loop that maps multimodal
inputs into a learned latent space and provides a probabilistic guarantee on correct goal interpreta-
tion, enabling proactive clarification before planning, and (iii) empirically show how this guarantee
can guide rapid refinement through fine-tuning and prompt optimization. Experiments show that
lightweight models trained on a limited number of high-guarantee samples achieve higher goal
classification accuracy.
2. Related Work
Practical applications and benchmarks in logistics.
Research in logistics and transportation
supports practical demands and provides benchmarks for evaluation. Classical formulations, for
example dynamic pickup-and-delivery Berbeglia et al. (2010) and airlift planning under operational
constraints Bertsimas et al. (2019) – establish the cost, capacity, and timing structures that real
systems must comply with. Recently, the Airlift Challenge frames cargo delivery as a community
benchmark with dynamic conditions Delanovic et al. (2024). Against this backdrop, LLM/VLM-
based systems are increasingly explored as front-ends that translate informal directives into struc-
tured goals. Yet, most existing demonstrations treat models as black-box solvers (Nicoletti and
Appolloni, 2025, 2024). We emphasizes transparent goal interpretation and compatibility with sym-
bolic verifiers, aiming to make conversational interfaces viable for logistics operations.
Natural language interfaces for planning.
Recent advances in LLMs have significantly im-
proved the ability to convert natural language into formal planning representations. Prior work
has explored using LLMs to translate high-level goals into formats such as PDDL, JSON, or action
graphs, enabling non-expert users to interact with complex systems (Song et al., 2022; Ichter et al.,
2022; Shah et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2022; Hao et al., 2024). Collectively, these works lower bar-
riers for non-experts and hence improve accessibility of the planner. On the downside, they assume
that the LLMs interpret user objectives correctly and lack verification mechanisms to ensure plan
correctness or goal alignment.
Uncertainty estimation in LLMs.
Uncertainty estimation in LLMs has gained increasing atten-
tion as a mechanism to detect hallucinations, flag low-confidence predictions, or guide interaction.
Techniques such as token-level entropy, Monte Carlo dropout, and calibration-based methods have
been applied to identify unreliable outputs (Gupta et al., 2024; Milan´es-Hermosilla et al., 2021;
Yang et al., 2024b; Bhatt et al., 2025). Together, these works motivate proactive interaction loops—
surfacing ambiguity before committing to a plan—but most stop short of offering guarantees on
intent correctness in logistics contexts.
Neurosymbolic and verification-informed planning.
Recent works combines neural models
with symbolic verification or formal reasoning systems for robotics and planning tasks, offering
correctness guarantees (Chen et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2024a; Li et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2023).
The VLL agent extends the neurosymbolic and verification ideas to the problem of natural lan-
guage goal interpretation in logistics, using uncertainty-aware learning to balance accessibility and
verifiability.

3. Problem Formulation
We develop a Vision–Language Logistics (VLL) agent: a neurosymbolic system that transforms free-
form, multimodal user instructions into certified, executable logistics decisions. The key challenge
is that user intent is often implicit or ambiguous, while downstream planners and solvers require
precise, structured specifications. We formalize two coupled problems: (P1) end-to-end VLL agent
construction with a three-stage architecture, and (P2) uncertainty-aware intent verification concen-
trated in the reasoning stage.
Notation and Model
Let t be an index. The user provides a multimodal prompt
xt ≜(It, Ut) ∈X,
where It is a natural-language instruction and Ut is a visual context (e.g., satellite imagery, camera
feeds, annotated maps). Let R denote a space of structured planning representations (e.g., PDDL
instances, SQL queries, or symbolic task graphs), and let Y = {1, . . . , K} denote a finite set of user
goals (e.g., query database, update database, solve a routing problem). We denote by y⋆
t ∈Y the
user’s true goal.
Design an End-to-End VLL Agent with Three Stages.
A VLL agent is a closed-loop system
composed of a perception module, a foundation model, and downstream solver.
A perception module processes visual inputs Ut to extract salient entities, attributes, and situational
cues, producing a grounded state abstraction st ∈S. This stage resolves linguistic referents such as
“the nearest operational airbase” or “avoid flooded regions.”
A foundation model fθ reasons the multimodal inputs and maps them into a structured specification
rt and a goal label yt:
(rt, yt) = fθ(It, st) ∈R × Y.
A downstream solver produces a candidate plan πt = Solve(rt), which is checked against domain
constraints Ct = C ∪rt (C is a set of universal constraints like safety rules, regulations, resource
limits) via a symbolic verifier. If verification fails, the agent returns diagnostic feedback and updates
the representation or user prompt.

FOUNDATION MODELS FOR CERTIFIABLE LOGISTICS
Develop an Uncertainty-Aware Intent Verification Loop.
Downstream planners assume that
the inferred goal yt correctly reflects the user’s intent. However, misclassification at the reasoning
stage can lead to optimal solutions for the wrong problem. We therefore require the reasoning stage
to be uncertainty-aware and certifiable.
Given input xt, the reasoning module outputs not only a predicted goal yt, but also a probabilistic
guarantee
ˆpt ≜ˆp(yt | xt),
which lower-bounds the probability that yt equals the true goal y⋆
t :
ˆp(yt | xt) ≤Pr(yt = y⋆
t | xt).
Uncertainty-Guided Refinement.
Develop a reasoning-stage mechanism that computes ˆp(yt |
xt), and uses this guarantee to guide both interactive clarification and uncertainty-filtered fine-tuning
of the foundation model fθ. Formally, given a stream of interaction data, we aim to maximize correct
goal inference conditioned on acceptance:
max
θ
Pr(fθ(x) = y⋆| ˆp(fθ(x) | x) ≥τ) ,
while controlling the clarification frequency induced by τ.
4. Vision-Language Logistic Agent
We design the VLL agent as a modular, closed-loop pipeline that integrates multimodal perception,
symbolic planning, and formal verification.
At each interaction round t, the agent receives visual+textual inputs (It, Ut). These inputs are pro-
cessed to a foundation model fθ that translates the multimodal input into a structured goal specifi-
cation rt expressed in the PDDL (Haslum et al., 2019), which serves as the interface to downstream
planners. Then, given a PDDL goal specification rt, an off-the-shelf PDDL solver is invoked to
synthesize a plan πt. We present the architecture in Figure 1.
Crucially, the reasoning stage does not commit to a PDDL goal unless the inferred user intent
(i.e., goal) has been verified with sufficient confidence. We propose an uncertainty-aware intent-
verification loop that acts as a gatekeeper between multimodal interpretation and symbolic planning,
ensuring that formal verification is applied only to goals that are certified to reflect user intent. We
present the online interface of the VLL agent with more demonstrations in the code repository.
4.1. Uncertainty-Aware Intent-Verification
We develop an uncertainty-aware intent-verification loop that (i) infers the user goal from mul-
timodal inputs, (ii) computes a calibrated probabilistic guarantee on intent correctness, and (iii)
triggers interactive clarification when the guarantee is insufficient. The goal is to ensure that down-
stream planning operates only on objectives that are both well-formed and certified to reflect user
intent. We present this loop in Figure 2.
5


--- Page 6 ---
We focus exclusively on the reasoning stage of the VLL agent. Perception and symbolic verification
are treated as black-box components that provide grounded inputs and constraint checks, respec-
tively. Our contribution is an intent-verification loop that sits between perception and planning and
provides formal guarantees on goal classification.
User Goal Classification.
Given a multimodal input xt = (It, Ut), the VLL agent uses a founda-
tion model fθ to infer the user’s goal. Concretely, the model treats intent inference as a classification
problem over a set of goals Y. The foundation model outputs yt = fθ(xt), where yt is the predicted
label corresponding to the user’s high-level goal (e.g., information retrieval, database update, or
logistics planning).
Latent Space Learning.
We train an embedding model P to map multimodal inputs and their pre-
dicted goals into an n-dimensional latent space Rn in which distinct user goals form well-separated
clusters. Using 400 manually labeled examples, we optimize P with a supervised contrastive loss.
Let zi = P(yi, Ii, Ui) ∈Rn denote the latent representation with label y∗
i . For a minibatch B and
positive set P(i) = {j ∈B \ {i} : yj = yi}, we minimize

where τ > 0 is a temperature parameter. Figure 3 illustrates the learned latent space for a three-class
goal classification task (see Empirical Analysis).
Guarantee on Classification Correctness.
Building on the clustered latent space, we formalize
how distances in the latent space are calibrated to a likelihood of classification correctness.
We define the probabilistic guarantee as a lower bound on the probability that the predicted goal yt
matches the user’s true goal y∗
t given the latent representation zt = P(yt, It, Ut) ∈Rn:
ˆp(yt | zt) = Pr

To estimate ˆp(yt | zt), we use a small calibration set of 200 manually labeled examples to construct
a calibration distribution with probability density function (PDF) FC. FC maps the distance dt =

FOUNDATION MODELS FOR CERTIFIABLE LOGISTICS
Proactive Clarification.
When the probabilistic guarantee ˆpt = ˆp(yt | zt) falls below a predefined
threshold τ, the VLL agent proactively enters a clarification mode before passing the goal to the
planner. In this mode, the agent implements a clarification loop governed by a threshold τ ∈(0, 1):
• If ˆpt ≥τ, the inferred goal yt is accepted and passed to the planner.
• If ˆpt < τ, the agent issues a targeted clarification query to the user (e.g., “Do you mean to
minimize cost or time?” or “Should weather conditions be considered?”).
This loop terminates at a stopping time T such that ˆp(yT | xT ) ≥τ, ensuring that planning proceeds
only after sufficient confidence in the intent correctness.
4.2. Uncertainty-Guided Refinement
We then develop two refinement methods that leverage the calibrated uncertainty signal, i.e., prob-
abilistic guarantee, to improve the VLL agent’s goal classification.
DPO with Guarantee Ranking.
The first method uses the probabilistic guarantee to induce pref-
erence rankings for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023). Given a user
input xt and a set of candidate interpretations {y(k)

}K
k=1 produced by the foundation model, we
compute their guarantees ˆp(k)

. For any pair (i, j) such that ˆp(i)
t
> bp(j)
t , we rank a
pair y(i)
t
≻y(j)
t . These ranked pairs are used to fine-tune the model via DPO by maximizing the
likelihood ratio between preferred and dispreferred goals.
TextGrad with Online Uncertainty Feedback.
In addition to model-parameter fine-tuning, we
employ TextGrad (Yuksekgonul et al., 2024) to optimize the system prompt using online interac-
tion feedback. We convert the probabilistic guarantee into auto-generated textual feedback (e.g.,
“the inferred goal is correct with approximately 75% confidence”), which serves as a differentiable
supervision signal for prompt optimization.
Generality Beyond Logistics.
Although demonstrated in a logistics setting, the uncertainty-aware
intent-verification loop is domain-agnostic and can be applied to any multimodal system requiring
reliable goal interpretation, such as robotic execution, autonomous driving, database querying, and
decision-support systems.
5. Empirical Analysis
We evaluate the intent verification pipeline through quantitative improvements in model perfor-
mance, demonstrating that proactive clarification and uncertainty-guided refinement significantly
improve the model’s ability to infer user goals in the context of logistics planning.
Experimental Setting.
We evaluate the VLL agent on a lightweight airlift logistics planning
domain designed to stress goal interpretation under uncertainty, rather than downstream opti-
mization quality. The learning task is to infer the user’s high-level goal yt ∈Y, where Y =
{Query, Update, Plan} corresponds to (i) extracting information from a logistics database, (ii) up-
dating the database, or (iii) solving a logistics planning problem. These categories capture the
dominant failure modes in conversational logistics systems, where an incorrect goal classification
leads to valid but operationally irrelevant plans.

from a fine-tuned model, where three classes of user goals are separated. The right plot shows the
calibration distributions of the three classes estimated via the learned latent space.
Figure 4: Comparison on goal classification accuracies and re-query frequencies. The fine-tuned
VLL achieves better performance than all other baselines with a lower frequency of re-query, show-
ing the effectiveness of uncertainty-guided fine-tuning in aligning model behavior with user goals.
We construct a dataset of 400 manually labeled interaction traces to learn the latent space, and an
additional 200 labeled samples to estimate the calibration distribution for the probabilistic guaran-
tee. For refinement, we follow Section 4.2 to create 100 samples for each refinement approach.
During evaluation, we use 200 testing samples that are independent to the training and calibration
data.
Baselines.
We compare the VLL agent against a set of foundation-model baselines summarized
in Figure 5. For all baselines, we directly query the model for goal classification without any
verification or clarification loop. Specifically, given a multimodal input xt = (It, Ut), the model is
prompted with an instruction of the form: “Classify the user goal based on the given inputs into
one of the following categories: Query, Update, or Plan.” We extract the predicted goal yt from the
model’s output.
We consider 6 baseline models as presented in Figure 5, all evaluated in a zero-shot setting using
the same prompt template.
Evaluation Metric.
We evaluate the impact of the proposed uncertainty-guided fine-tuning on the
VLL agent’s foundation model fθ (GPT-4o-mini backbone) and use three metrics:
Threshold is a scalar cut-off value τ to the probabilistic guarantee ˆpt = ˆp(yt | zt). Only samples
with scores above τ are retained for accuracy evaluation.

Re-query Frequency is the proportion of evaluation samples for which the uncertainty signal falls
below the threshold τ, triggering a clarification query to the user. Lower values indicate fewer
interruptions for clarification, while higher values suggest more frequent user interaction to resolve
intent ambiguity.
Results and Analysis.
Figures 4 and 5 present the quantitative results of uncertainty-aware refine-
ment on goal classification. Figure 4 illustrates the trade-off between goal classification accuracy
and re-query frequency as the acceptance threshold τ varies. Across all thresholds, VLL consistently
achieve higher accuracy for a fixed clarification rate compared to zero-shot foundation models.
Figure 5 compares the VLL agents against increasingly larger foundation-model baselines. Despite
using a significantly smaller backbone, the VLL outperforms 20x larger models such as GPT-5 in
goal classification accuracy while inducing faster response time. Notably, the combined refinement
strategy (fine-tuning + prompt optimization) yields the strongest overall performance, showing the
effectiveness of our uncertainty-guided refinement strategies.
Table 1 provides qualitative insight into this improvement by illustrating prompt optimization driven
by uncertainty feedback. In each example, the refined prompt produced by the VLL agent is more
explicit and operationally grounded, leading to a higher probabilistic guarantee ˆpt. Together, these
results indicate that uncertainty-aware verification and refinement improve both the correctness of
inferred goals and the clarity of model reasoning, which are critical for reliable conversational lo-
gistics systems.
Ablation Study.
We conduct an ablation study to assess the necessity of each component in the
uncertainty-aware intent-verification and refinement. All variants share the same foundation model
backbone and training data. We present the classification accuracy and average classification latency
per query in Table 2. For each variant, we use the corresponding uncertainty signal to fine-tune the
backbone foundation model and present the accuracy and the average inference time. There is no
fine-tuning if the signal is not specified. We show that removing any single component degrades the
classification accuracy, while does not significantly reduce the latency.

6. Conclusion
We introduce a neurosymbolic framework for conversational logistics that prioritizes certifiable goal
interpretation over black-box plan generation. By mapping multimodal user inputs into a learned
latent space and computing a calibrated probabilistic guarantee on goal correctness, the VLL agent
can proactively clarify ambiguous user requests and guide uncertainty-aware refinement to its back-
bone foundation model. Empirical results show that these mechanisms enable smaller foundation
models to outperform substantially larger ones in goal classification accuracy while reducing un-
necessary clarification, demonstrating that structured uncertainty signals are more critical than raw
model scale for reliable conversational logistics.
Future work will extend VLL agents beyond intent verification to end-to-end certifiable logistics
pipelines. Potential directions include integrating symbolic proof engines to generate machine-
checkable certificates of plan correctness, supporting real-time grounding from streaming percep-
tual inputs, and enabling cache-guided plan updates under changing conditions.

FOUNDATION MODELS FOR CERTIFIABLE LOGISTICS
Appendix A. Theoretical Support for Probabilistic Guarantee
We provide theoretical supports for the probabilistic guarantee ˆp(yt | zt) used in our uncertainty-
aware intent–verification pipeline. Specifically, we show how distances in the learned latent space,
constructed from multimodal embeddings of textual and visual inputs, can be mapped to calibrated
confidence estimates on user intent classification. By leveraging geometric separation properties be-
tween intent clusters, we establish bounds on misclassification probability, which is the probabilistic
guarantee ˆp(yt | zt).
Definition 1 (Distance to Centroid)
Let Z ⊂Rn be the latent embedding space induced by the
multimodal encoder P, which jointly embeds textual and visual inputs (It, Ut) along with their
predicted intent labels yt. Suppose C = {c1, c2, . . . , cK} denotes the set of cluster centroids for K
intent classes, estimated from a calibration dataset Dc of size Nc. For a given input (It, Ut) with
latent embedding zt = P(It, Ut, yt), define the Euclidean distance to the nearest centroid as:
dt = min
ck∈C ∥zt −ck∥2.
Definition 2 (Calibration Distribution) A calibration distribution, whose probability density func-
tion is FC : R+ →[0, 1], is the distribution of distances from correctly classified calibration sam-
ples to their corresponding class centroids. Given a new input, the function FC takes the distance
dt to its nearest centroid c∗as input, and returns a probability that a sample from another class lies
beyond dt:
Pr

||zi −c∗||2 > dt
 yi ̸= y∗
c

,
y∗
c is the ground truth label. This distribution is approximated by using a labeled calibration dataset.
Theorem 3 (Latent Distance to Probabilistic Guarantee)
Given a new input, we compute its distance dt to the nearest centroid and compute the probabilistic
guarantee
ˆp(yt | zt) =
 1 −FC(dt)

is the number of other-class samples over the total number of samples, and Pr

is the percentage of samples whose distance to c∗is within dt.
Proof According to Definition 2, given a new input whose latent space distance to its nearest
centroid is dt, then
FC(dt) = Pr

that
