ABSTRACT Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been envisioned to play a more important
role in future wireless networks. However, the design of ISAC networks is challenging, especially
when there are multiple communication and sensing (C&S) nodes and multiple sensing targets. We
investigate a multi-base station (BS) ISAC network in which multiple BSs equipped with multiple antennas
simultaneously provide C&S services for multiple ground communication users (CUs) and targets. To
enhance the overall performance of C&S, we formulate a joint user association (UA) and multi-BS
transmit beamforming optimization problem with the objective of maximizing the total sum rate of all
CUs while ensuring both the minimum target detection and parameter estimation requirements in terms
of the radar signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the Cram´er-Rao bound (CRB), respectively. To efficiently
solve the highly non-convex mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) optimization problem, we
propose an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm that decomposes the problem into two sub-
problems, i.e., UA optimization and multi-BS transmit beamforming optimization. Inspired by the huge
potential of large language models (LLMs) for prediction and inference, we propose a unified framework
integrating LLMs with convex-based optimization methods to benefit from the theoretical rigorousness and
convergence guarantees of convex-based methods, and the adaptability and flexibility of LLMs. First, we
propose a comprehensive design of prompt engineering based on in-context, few-shot, chain of thought,
and self-reflection techniques to guide LLMs in solving the binary integer programming UA optimization
problem. Second, we utilize convex-based optimization methods to handle the non-convex beamforming
optimization problem based on fractional programming (FP), majorization minimization (MM), and the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with an optimized UA from LLMs. Numerical results
demonstrate that our proposed LLM-enabled AO-based algorithm achieves fast convergence and near upper-
bound performance with the GPT-o1 model, outperforming various benchmark schemes, which shows the
advantages of integrating LLMs into convex-based optimization for wireless networks.

I. Introduction
The forthcoming sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks
are expected to not only provide ubiquitous communication
services with ultra-high data rates but also perform high-
precision sensing [1], [2]. The resulting communication and
sensing (C&S) system requires more resources in terms of

frequency bands and hardware complexity to meet stringent
multi-faceted performance requirements. Towards this end,
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been
identified as a promising technology combining sensing and
communication functionalities into a single system, in which
C&S share the same frequency bands and hardware plat-
forms to substantially improve spectral and energy efficiency
with limited hardware complexity [3]–[5]. Meanwhile, multi-
input and multi-output (MIMO) techniques, first introduced
in [6], have become a critical enabler for ISAC systems
thanks to the large numbers of degrees of freedom (DoFs)
offered by the multiple antennas deployed at both transmit-
ters and receivers [7], [8]. With MIMO, ISAC systems can
flexibly design transceiver beamforming and signal wave-
forms to generate directional beams towards the locations
of CUs and sensing targets, thus enhancing communication
rates and sensing accuracy [9].
Motivated by MIMO-enabled ISAC, there are a number
of research works focusing on transmit beamforming design,
including [10]–[18]. Specifically, the authors in [10] con-
sidered an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled ISAC
system, in which the UAV is equipped with a vertical
uniform linear array (ULA) and acts as an aerial dual-
functional access point (AP). The maneuvers and transmit
beamforming of the UAV are jointly optimized to maximize
the weighted sum rate of the CUs while ensuring the sensing
requirements. As a further advance, the authors in [11] aimed
to jointly design the transmit beamforming and trajectories of
UAVs equipped with ULAs in an ISAC network to maximize
the achievable cover rate for legitimate ground users. To
efficiently explore the spatial DoFs of the MIMO ISAC sys-
tem, the authors in [12] considered two different approaches
to MIMO antenna usage: separate antenna deployment by
partitioning MIMO antennas into radar and communication
antennas, and sharing all the antennas for both radar sens-
ing and downlink communications. The numerical results
showed that the shared deployment achieved better perfor-
mance in terms of the trade-off between C&S. Different from
[12], the authors in [13] designed the transmit beamforming
to fully extend the DoFs of the MIMO antennas through
jointly utilizing the precoded individual communication and
radar waveforms, which mitigates the interference between
the communication and sensing signals. To improve the
C&S trade-off performance and its impact on cell-free (CF)
MIMO systems, the authors in [14] optimized transmit beam-
forming designs to suppress the interference and provide
high-quality communication and sensing services, which
were shown to outperform the zero-forcing (ZF) and the
maximum ratio transmission (MRT) schemes. In [15], the au-
thors investigated a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-
aided multi-user-MIMO (MU-MIMO) ISAC system, where
the RIS reflection coefficients and transmit beamforming
were jointly optimized to both enhance the target detection
and parameter estimation performance with respect to the
radar output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the estimation
Cram´er-Rao bound (CRB), respectively. Furthermore, the
authors in [16] considered an active RIS-empowered ISAC
system, in which the transmit beamforming and active RIS
beamforming were jointly optimized to minimize the CRB
for target direct-of-arrival (DoA) estimation. To explore
ISAC in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) networks, the authors
in [17], [18] proposed a deep learning (DL)-based approach
to provide predictive beamforming for tracking on-road ve-
hicles while reducing the signaling overhead and enhancing
the ISAC performance.
Despite significant progress in MIMO ISAC system de-
sign, the existing results in [10]–[18] still face formidable
challenges. The simultaneous execution of C&S tasks in a
MIMO ISAC system necessitates the joint design of transmit
beamforming, transmit power allocation, and interference
management strategies to achieve the expected trade-off
between the C&S performance metrics. The balance required
among multiple objectives, such as sum rates, target de-
tection, and parameter estimation, complicates the system
design and makes the underlying optimization problem non-
trivial and computationally intensive. Therefore, optimiza-
tion tools, including model-based convex optimization [10]–
[16], data-driven DL [17]–[19], and reinforcement learning
(RL) [20]–[22] are exploited to tackle the resulting highly
complex optimization problems. As for convex-based opti-
mization tools, such as the Lagrangian algorithm, successive
convex approximation (SCA), and semidefinite relaxation
(SDR) [23], the resulting optimization algorithms can gen-
erate a sub-optimal or even near-optimal solution with rel-
atively low computational complexity, even for highly non-
convex problems. The powerful data-driven capabilities of
DL have advantages for model-free and non-linear mapping,
as they are able to handle very high-dimensional input space
while potentially learning to capture the characteristics of
complex optimization problems [24]. RL-based optimization
algorithms can learn the optimal policy by interacting with
the system in real time, which is suitable for use cases
with unknown system dynamics and complex reward func-
tions [20]. However, the above-mentioned tools have their
limitations. To be more specific, as the network system
complexity increases, convex-based optimization methods
may suffer from the growing dimensionality and may get
trapped in local convergence, while DL methods may be
restricted by the growing complexity and volume of training
data, computational demands and over-fitting risks, and
for RL methods may have the issue of convergence and
stability decrease [25]. Another limitation of convex-based
optimization, DL, and RL methods is their inherent reliance
on expert domain knowledge. For instance, model-based con-
vex optimization tools require expert knowledge, including
communication theory, signal processing, and optimization
theory. Model-free data-driven DL and RL methods demand
network expert knowledge to formulate network optimization
problems as regression tasks by correctly capturing network
characteristics and mapping network status (inputs) to the

policies (outputs) based on specifically designed neural net-
work structures and the parameters learned from the labeled
dataset [26]. Both model-based and model-free methods
require substantial expertise for each new network scenario,
which can be time- and resource-consuming and substan-
tially restrict scalability and flexibility in the dynamically
changing environments of wireless networks. With superior
generalization capabilities and knowledge integration, large
language models (LLMs) can address this limitation by
utilizing substantial inherent expert knowledge, thereby sig-
nificantly reducing the expertise dependence and enhancing
model adaptability and flexibility.
Recently, LLMs have emerged as powerful tools with
demonstrated capabilities in natural language processing
(NLP) applications, particularly for different aspects of prob-
lem optimization [27]–[32]. For instance, the authors in [27],
[28] leveraged LLMs as optimizers to solve general math
problems via optimization task-specific prompts. The authors
in [29] investigated a novel approach that integrated LLMs as
black-box search operators into multi-objective evolutionary
algorithms (MOEAs) in a zero-shot manner. The authors in
[30] introduced a novel framework named LLAMBO that ex-
ploited the reasoning capabilities of LLM to enhance model-
based Bayesian optimization via prompt engineering without
fine-tuning. Moreover, the authors in [31], [32] explored the
capabilities of LLMs in combinatorial optimization by inte-
grating LLMs into the evolution of a heuristics framework
through problem-specific descriptions in prompts. LLMs
offer several key advantages over traditional optimization
approaches. First, LLMs exhibit strong adaptability across
diverse tasks due to their pre-training on extensive datasets,
enabling them to develop comprehensive domain knowl-
edge [33]. Unlike convex-based optimization methods, which
require strict mathematical formulations, LLMs can handle
general optimization problems using more natural problem
representations. Additionally, LLMs can effectively leverage
transfer learning for rapid domain adaptation with minimal
fine-tuning requirements. Their ability to process natural
language descriptions of optimization problems provides
interpretability and flexibility advantages over conventional
DL and RL approaches [34]. Consequently, recent studies
have explored the potential of LLMs for wireless networks
[35]–[41]. For instance, the authors in [35] proposed a novel
framework named WirelessLLM empowered with knowl-
edge and expertise for adapting and enhancing LLMs to
solve general optimization problems in practical wireless
scenarios like power allocation and spectrum sensing. The
authors in [37], [38] leveraged LLMs for simple radio map
generation and optimization for network planning, which
improved the efficiency of AP deployment and management.
By integrating LLMs as black-box search operators in evo-
lutionary algorithms, the authors in [41] proposed a novel
LLM-enabled multi-object evolutionary algorithm for finding
the C&S trade-off in a multi-UAV ISAC system, which
outperformed traditional evolutionary algorithms in terms
of the Pareto fronts and convergence obtained. All of the
above works have demonstrated the capabilities of LLMs in
solving optimization problems in wireless networks. Despite
the promising potential of LLMs demonstrated in prior
works [35]–[41], current LLMs still cannot efficiently solve
highly complex non-convex optimization problems based
only on prompts. More specifically, model-based and model-
free optimization algorithms exploit gradient information
of the objective function to precisely regulate the search
direction and the step size at each iteration, which results in
algorithm convergence. However, LLMs depend on discrete
tokens from the prompt without information of numerical
gradients. They lack the precision and stability for high-
dimensional complex-valued computations and are unable
to guarantee algorithm convergence due to the stochastic
sampling of the iteratively generated tokens. Furthermore,
LLMs are limited by the size of their context windows,
which restricts them to articulating algorithmic concepts or
pseudocodes rather than executing high-dimensional numer-
ical optimization. Consequently, LLMs are more suitable as
black-box heuristic solvers for optimization problems for
which gradient information is not available. These obser-
vations motivate us to integrate LLMs with the existing
optimization algorithm framework.
To the best of our knowledge, the integration of LLMs
and convex-based optimization techniques for wireless com-
munication network design remains unexplored. A unified
framework that seamlessly integrates LLM-based techniques
with traditional convex-based optimization could leverage
the best of both worlds: the theoretical rigorousness and
global convergence guarantees of convex-based optimization
combined with the adaptability and flexibility of LLMs. Such
a framework can provide the benefits of reducing extensive
model training to adapt to wireless environments. Incorpo-
rating LLMs into the convex-based optimization framework
can significantly alleviate the extensive reliance on expert-
dependent training processes associated with traditional data-
driven methods, which often require large-scale labeled
datasets and domain-specific feature engineering, requiring
considerable manual effort and expertise. In contrast, LLMs
inherently capture generalized knowledge, which enables
rapid adaptation to new optimization scenarios with minimal
fine-tuning, reducing the need for explicit domain expertise
and leading to shorter development cycles and lower training
overhead. Motivated by the above discussion, we propose a
framework that integrates LLMs and convex-based optimiza-
tion for a general MU-MIMO ISAC system, as shown in Fig.
1, where multiple ISAC BSs serve multiple ground CUs and
perform radar sensing for multiple targets. In particular, each
BS is equipped with multiple antennas and simultaneously
detects the presence of targets and estimates the DoAs, while
all BSs collaboratively serve all the ground CUs. Under
this setup, we aim to design the user association (UA)
strategy jointly with the multi-BS transmit beamforming
for optimization of the total communication performance of

all CUs while ensuring the detection and DoA estimation
requirements of multiple targets. The main contributions of
this paper are summarized as follows:
• Firstly, we investigate a multi-BS ISAC network, where
multiple BSs equipped with multiple antennas simulta-
neously provide communication services for multiple
ground CUs while performing sensing for multiple
targets. To evaluate the C&S performance, for radar
sensing, we adopt the radar SNR as the target detection
metric and the CRB as the target DoA estimation
metric. For communications, we use the sum rate of all
ground CUs as our communication metric. Based on
the proposed metrics, we jointly take the UA strategy
and the multi-BS transmit beamforming design into
consideration to formulate the sum rate maximization
problem while ensuring the detection and DoA estima-
tion requirements of multiple targets.
• Secondly, to efficiently solve the highly non-convex
problem, we first decompose the original problem into
a UA sub-problem and a transmit beamforming sub-
problem and solve them in an alternating optimization
(AO) manner iteratively until convergence. We propose
integrating LLMs and convex-based optimization into a
single framework to exploit the theoretical rigorousness
and convergence guarantees of convex-based optimiza-
tion with the adaptability and flexibility of LLMs.
Specifically, for the integer programming UA optimiza-
tion problem, we propose a novel LLM-based algorithm
based on prompt engineering to generate a high-quality
UA strategy. To effectively adapt LLMs for optimiza-
tion, we specifically design the prompt engineering
based on the in-context, few-shot, chain of thought,
and self-reflection prompting design techniques. For
the transmit beamforming optimization problem, we
decompose it into a series of sub-problems with respect
to the transmit beamforming at each BS and solve them
simultaneously for a given UA. However, the resulting
sub-problem is still highly non-convex due to the objec-
tive function and the sensing requirement constraints.
To tackle this issue, we propose an alternating direc-
tion method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm
using the techniques of fractional programming (FP),
augmented Lagrangian algorithm, and majorization-
minimization (MM) to iteratively optimize the transmit
beamforming for each BS.
• Thirdly, we conduct extensive simulations to show the
effectiveness of the proposed LLM-enabled AO-based
algorithm design compared with several benchmark
methods. We also compare the performance of multiple
LLMs, including GPT-o1, GPT-4-Turbo, Claude 3.5,
and Gemini 2.0. It is shown that the proposed algo-
rithm using the GPT-o1 model can achieve a similar,
and sometimes the same performance as an upper
bound and outperforms a benchmark method using only
convex-based optimization techniques or other LLM-
based schemes in terms of the total sum rate and con-
vergence speed. This demonstrates the effectiveness of
our designed prompt engineering for adapting LLMs to
the optimization problem. In addition, with increasing
system complexity, the proposed algorithm can still
approach the upper bound and outperform benchmark
schemes, which reveals the robustness and efficiency of
the proposed algorithm.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion II presents the system model of the considered multi-CU
multi-BS ISAC system. Section III formulates the optimiza-
tion problem for total sum rate maximization while ensuring
the detection and DoA estimation requirements of multiple
targets. Section IV introduces the LLM-enabled AO-based
algorithm design for solving the formulated problem. Section
V provides numerical results to study the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithm. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper.

II. System Model
We consider a multi-BS ISAC system, as shown in Fig. 1,
where K ISAC BSs serve a total of N single-antenna ground
CUs and perform radar sensing for a total of Q targets.
We denote the set of ISAC BSs as K = {1, 2, . . . , K},

set of targets as Q = {Q1, Q2, . . . , QK}, respectively.
In this system, each ISAC BS is assumed to be a dual-
functional radar-communication (DFRC) BS equipped with
M antennas. We assume that all ISAC BSs can receive
sensing echo signals and maintain downlink communications
concurrently without interference by exploiting full-duplex
radio technologies [42], [43]. All ISAC BSs are supposed to
serve all ground CUs collaboratively. We assume that ISAC
BS k senses the set of targets in the area of interest, denoted
as Qk, and Q1∪Q2∪· · ·∪QK = Q. To simplify our system,
we model all targets as point targets. In this system, we

C. Sensing Model
We assume that each BS k is supposed to sense a specific
subset of targets in the area of interest of BS k, i.e., Qk,
and there is no overlap between any two target subsets, i.e.,
Qk ∩Qj = ∅, ∀k, j ∈K, k ̸= j, and Q1 ∪Q2 · · · ∪QK =
Q. In each subset Qk, there is one target ˜Qk for detection
and one target ˆQk for parameter estimation, respectively. To
simplify illustration, we assume all BSs operate in the time
division multiple access (TDMA) mode or apply enhanced
inter-cell interference coordination techniques such as those
in LTE Rel.10 to limit inter-cell interference [45]. The signal
echoes transmitted by BS k reflected by targets and received

target i and BS k.
III. Performance Metrics
In this section, we first separately derive the sensing
detection and parameter estimation performance metrics, and
then formulate the sum rate of all ground CUs as our
communication metric.
A. Target Detection
In this section, we will show that the probability of target
detection is positively related to the radar SNR, which is
used as our sensing performance metric for target detection.
Assume that the system has prior knowledge of the DoA of
each target via some localization algorithms or estimation
methods based on previous observations [46]. Each BS

C. Communication Metrics
In this section, we derive the sum rate of all ground CUs
as our communication performance metric. To start with, we
define the UA matrix U ∈CK×N as
U = [u1, u2, · · · , uN] =


u1,1, u1,2, · · · , u1,N

eu1...
uK,1, uK,2, · · · , uK,N




(23)
We denote ui = [u1,i, u2,i, · · · , uK,i]T ∈CK×1 as the UA
vector of CU i, where uk,i is a binary variable. Specifically,
uk,i ∈{0, 1}, ∀k, ∀i, and uk,i = 1 if CU i is associated
with BS k. Otherwise, uk,i = 0. ||euk||0 is the number of
CUs served by BS k. It is assumed that each CU can only be
served by one BS, which means that ||ui||0 = 1. Therefore,
the achievable data rate from BS k to CU i is defined as
Rk,i, which is given by
Rk,i =
B
||euk||0
log2(1 + γk,i),
(24)
where B is the total bandwidth allocated to BS k. Based
on (24), the achievable data rate of CU i in bps/Hz can be
rewritten as
Ri =

IV. Problem Formulation
In this paper, we aim to maximize the sum rate of all
ground CUs while guaranteeing the sensing performance of
all targets subject to the maximum transmit power constraints
and UA requirements. In this section, we first formulate the
joint BS beamforming matrices and UA strategy optimization
problem. Then, we decompose the original problem into
UA and BS transmit beamforming matrix optimization sub-
problems.
A. Formulation of Problem
Based on the performance metrics derived in Section III,
our goal is to maximize the total sum rate of all ground CUs
subject to the radar SNR and DoA estimation CRB con-
straints of all targets and the maximum BS transmit power
budget constraints by jointly optimizing with BS transmit
beamforming matrices {Wk}K
k=1 and the UA strategy U.
Therefore, the optimization problem can be formulated as

denotes the DoA estimation CRB threshold, and Pt denotes
the maximum BS transmit power budget. Constraints (27a)
and (27b) represent the sensing performance requirements.
Constraint (27c) ensures that the BS transmit power does
not exceed the maximum power budget. Constraint (27d)
indicates that each BS should serve at least one ground CU.
Constraint (27e) ensures that each CU can only be served
by a single BS.
Problem (P1) is a highly non-convex mixed-integer opti-
mization problem including continuous variables {Wk}K
k=1
and integer variables U due to the highly coupled optimiza-
tion problem (27) and highly non-convex constraints (27a),
(27b), and (27f). Thus, it is generally challenging to directly
obtain a global optimal solution. To tackle this challenging
problem, we decompose the original problem (P1) into two
sub-problems and alternatively solve them via AO.
B. Problem Decomposition
To efficiently solve problem (P1), we alternatively solve
two sub-problems in two independent phases: the UA phase
and the beamforming optimization phase. We optimize
the two phases alternately in each outer iteration until
convergence. First, given initial BS beamforming matrices
{W(0)

k=1, we obtain the initial UA strategy by solving
sub-problem (P2), which can be written as

To realize such a coordinated multi-cell optimization
framework, we assume there exists a remote cloud server
acting as a control server while the multiple BSs act as
edge servers. The cloud controller and edge BSs form a
hierarchical network. Specifically, the cloud server gath-
ers comprehensive cross-cell information, including channel
state information (CSI), user association patterns, and pre-
coding/beamforming matrices from all edge BSs participat-
ing in coordinated beamforming. The cloud server analyzes
the collected data, executes optimization algorithms, and
distributes the optimized solutions back to the edge BSs
for local execution. The edge BSs then implement the
instructions obtained from the connected cloud server via
an optical backhaul link in real-time, dynamically managing
local beamforming and resource allocation decisions to en-
sure optimized performance in a rapidly changing wireless
environment.
V. LLM-Enabled AO-Based Algorithm Design
To solve problem (P1), we decompose it into two sub-
problems (P2) and (P3) and apply an AO-based algorithm
to iteratively optimize UA and BS transmit beamforming by
combining LLMs and convex-based optimization as follows:
A. LLM-based User Association Optimization
In what follows, we propose an LLM-based framework to
solve the UA strategy optimization sub-problem (P2) given
the BS beamforming matrices. Problem (P2) is a binary
integer programming problem that cannot be directly solved
due to the huge number of possible UA combinations for
large N and K. To efficiently optimize U, inspired by the
substantial mathematical capabilities of LLMs, we utilize
LLMs as a black-box solver for problem (P2).

Fine-tuning Pre-trained Foundation Models (PFMs), in-
cluding Large Language Models (LLMs), is expected to
be instrumental in facilitating intelligent, hierarchical co-
ordination across future 6G networks. These networks are
envisioned to span cloud infrastructures, edge servers such
as base stations or intelligent edge nodes, and a wide
range of user equipment. To enable such coordination, the
fine-tuning process should begin with the development of
diversified datasets that capture the heterogeneity of 6G
environments, including dynamic mobility patterns, variable
quality-of-service (QoS) demands, and stringent resource
constraints. The fine-tuning of PFMs should be approached
in a hierarchical manner, where cloud infrastructures fo-
cus on global optimization tasks such as strategic resource
management and interference coordination. In parallel, edge
servers are responsible for context-specific functionalities,
such as low-latency task execution and localized sensing. At
the user level, models are expected to provide personalized
services and adapt to the immediate environment of the
user. Given the dynamic nature of 6G networks, techniques
such as prompt engineering allow PFMs to generalize to
new conditions with minimal retraining. To utilize LLMs
resource-efficiently and flexibly for solving problem (P2),
we aim to design prompt engineering to adapt LLMs for
optimization using several techniques.
1) Motivation for Prompt Engineering
The design of effective prompts is critical for guiding
LLMs so that their outputs are relevant, consistent, and
aligned with user intent. Various prompting methods embody
distinct principles and are suitable for different scenarios. In
this work, we aim to design a comprehensive prompt for
solving UA strategy optimization sub-problem (P2). We first
utilize in-context prompting along with expert knowledge
to provide background knowledge for LLMs. Then, we
utilize the zero-shot chain of thought techniques to ask
LLMs to give an initial solution to the optimization problem.
Following the idea of self-reflection, we ask LLMs, provided
with few-shot prior examples, to self-enhance their solutions
iteratively until the objective function value converges. By
comprehensively and strategically applying these diverse
prompting strategies, we can tailor prompts to meet the
specific demands of a given task, thereby optimizing the
performance and quality of LLM output. For illustration
purposes, we briefly introduce the prompt techniques used
in our design.
First, in-context prompting embeds pertinent background
information directly into the prompt to ensure that LLM
responses are enriched with relevant context, which is use-
ful for tasks requiring in-depth analysis. Moreover, expert
knowledge ensures that the embedded background informa-
tion is both accurate and relevant to the domain at hand,
which allows the prompts to precisely guide the LLMs [35].
Second, zero-shot prompting uses clear and direct in-
structions without providing examples, which is suitable for
simple tasks or situations that demand prompt responses.
However, it may encounter difficulties when addressing
ambiguous requirements in more complex cases [49]. In con-
trast, few-shot prompting improves clarity by incorporating
exemplar inputs that define the desired output format, which
is suitable for tasks with nuanced requirements.
Third, chain of thought prompting encourages LLMs to
articulate intermediate reasoning steps that lead to the final
answer to one complex problem. The chain of thought
provides an interpretable window for LLMs to reach the
correct answer and debug where the reasoning path might
go wrong [50].
Finally, the self-reflection technique has proven to be a
powerful tool that enables LLMs to learn from their mis-
takes, self-correct, and generate more accurate outputs [51].
For complex problem-solving, self-reflection is especially
beneficial when dealing with tasks that require multi-step
reasoning or synthesizing information from multiple sources.
By evaluating their initial approaches and identifying errors,
LLMs can refine their strategies and produce more precise
solutions, ultimately leading to improved results.
2) Prompting-Based LLM as a Black-Box Optimizer
We aim to design prompt engineering using the techniques
of in-context learning and chain of thought in an iterative
self-reflection manner, which enables LLMs to generate a
mathematical model of our optimization problem (P2) based
on the prompt and find a near-optimal UA strategy. The
structure of the designed prompting involves background
description, optimization problem description, task instruc-
tions, self-enhancement, and expected outputs, as follows
(also shown in Fig. 2).
a) Background description: In this part, we aim to provide
LLMs with the necessary background knowledge of our
problem. Specifically, as shown in Fig. 2, we first specify
the role of LLMs as experts in wireless communications.
Consequently, LLMs are expected to understand the fol-
lowing question using their expert knowledge of wireless
communications. Then, we introduce the system settings of
our problem to the LLMs, including the number of BSs and
ground CUs and the UA rules. Such information provides
LLMs with a clear picture of our system, which helps them
better understand the optimization problem. Moreover, to fa-
cilitate LLMs to accurately generate the mathematical model
of the optimization problem (P2), we provide LLMs with
extra expert knowledge as highlighted in Fig. 2. Specifically,
we instruct the LLMs to calculate the communication rate
from each BS to each CU using the Shannon capacity while
considering the bandwidth allocation of multiple CUs. This
background context serves as a foundation for guiding LLMs
to better understand the problem and reduce ambiguity in the

You are an expert in wireless communications. Consider a communication scenario where multiple base stations provide communication 
services to multiple ground communication users (CU). There are {Number_of_BSs} base stations and {Number_of_CUs} ground CUs in 
total. For each ground CU, it can only be served by one base station. For each base station, it can serve multiple CUs. The signal-to-
interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is given by a {Number_of_CUs} × {Number_of_BSs} matrix below: 
[0.0628, 0.0270, 0.0015;
0.0052, 0.0035, 0.1401; 
0.3688, 0.0198, 0.0968;

……
0.0022, 0.0255, 0.2609].
The bandwidth allocated to each base station is 1 Hz. 
Expert Knowledge:
The rate between each base station and each ground CU is computed using Shannon capacity. CUs served by the same base 
station are equally assigned the same bandwidth.
Background Description
#Objective Description: Maximize the total sum-rate of all CUs.
#Constraint Description: For each ground CU, it can only be served by one base station. For each base station, it can serve multiple CUs 
and at least serve one CU.
Optimization Problem Description
You only output the matrix. Your output must have the same format as the example. Do not give any explanation.
#Example of the user association matrix:
[0 0 1;1 0 0;0 0 1;...].
Expected Outputs
Given your formulated model, you are asked to solve this 
problem. 
Chain of  Thought:
Let’s think step by step. Each base station initially serves
multiple CUs. The more CUs base station serves, the less
bandwidth is allocated to each CU. This means that the 
sum-rate of CUs served by the same base station becomes 
smaller if more CUs are served due to the less bandwidth
allocated to each CU. This means that if a base station only 
serves the CU with the SINR which dominates the sum-rate,
the resulting sum-rate is larger than that for multiple CUs.
Give me the optimal user association matrix to maximize 
the total sum-rate of all CUs. 
Self-Enhancement
The new user association should result in a higher total 
sum-rate compared with the old user association.

instructions, which can effectively set the stage for in-context
learning.
b) Optimization problem description: In this part, given the
specified background descriptions and expert knowledge, we
elaborate optimization problem (P2) with natural language
for LLMs. To help LLMs better distinguish between the
objective function and constraints, we highlight the objective
and constraint descriptions using special marks, which can
clarify and enhance the structure of the prompt.
c) Task instructions: In this part, we clarify the task
instructions for LLMs. First, we instruct the LLMs to for-
mulate the mathematical model of our optimization problem
(P2). Given the background knowledge and a clearly struc-
tured problem description, LLMs can accurately formulate
problem (P2), as shown in Fig. 2. Then, we instruct LLMs to
solve the formulated problem to generate a near-optimal UA
strategy. To achieve this goal, we utilize the chain of thought
technique to guide the LLMs, as highlighted in Fig. 2. More
specifically, the chain of thought guides LLMs in solving
the optimization problem step by step. LLMs are asked to
consider that the sum rate of the CUs served by the same
base station becomes smaller if more CUs are served. Then,
the LLMs consider that the BS should give priority to the
CU with the largest SINR if the sum rate is dominated by
such a CU to maximize the total sum rate. Then, the LLMs
are supposed to find the optimal UA strategy to maximize
the objective function under the above guidance. The chain
of thought prompting encourages LLMs to break down the
reasoning process into intermediate steps, which can lead to
more accurate and robust problem solving.
d) Self-enhancement: Initially, the LLMs may generate
unexpected or incorrect solutions. To tackle this issue, in
this part, we aim to make LLMs iteratively self-refine
the solutions obtained in previous iterations as highlighted
in Fig. 2. Specifically, in each iteration, we provide the
prior UA strategy and the objective function value from
the previous iteration to guide LLMs to self-refine their
solutions until the objective function value exceeds that from
the last iteration or the objective function value meets the
convergence criteria.
e) Expected outputs: In this part, we describe the expected
output solutions. The output of LLM should only be given in
our expected format. As shown in Fig. 2, the output response
from LLMs is given exactly in the expected format.
3) Algorithm Summary
Given the above designs, the proposed framework of
the prompting-based black-box optimizer is summarized in
Algorithm 1.

to solve the BS transmit beamforming optimization sub-
problem (P3) given a fixed UA strategy U∗. It is clear

that problem (P3) is highly non-convex even with fixed
integer variables due to the log2(·) in the objective function
(29) and constraints (29a), (29b). To effectively optimize
Wk, k = 1, . . . , K, for each BS k, we further decom-
pose the problem (P3) into a series of sub-problems and
solve them simultaneously, where each sub-problem omitting

To solve this problem, we propose an algorithm framework
based on FP, MM, and ADMM to decompose problem (P3.k)
into a series of sub-problems and solve them iteratively until
convergence.
1) Problem reformulation based on FP
Based on [52], we introduce a Lagrangian dual reformu-
lation of problem (P3.k) by introducing a set of auxiliary
variables υ = [υ1, υ2, · · · , υN]T . The reformulated objective

problem reformulation is provided in Part II of [53]. Given
a fixed υ, to optimize Wk, we expand the third quadratic
form and further recast Φ(Wk, υ) as

To

the
reformulated
objec-
tive function Φ(Wk, υ, b), we introduce vector variable
wk ∈CM(M+N)×1 by vertically stacking the wk,i, i =
1, 2, · · · , N +M. Therefore, objective function Φ(Wk, υ, b)
can be equivalently expressed as
Φ(wk, υ, b) = Re{f Hwk} −||Fwk||2
2 + δ(υ, b),
(33)
where δ(υ, b) collects all forms that do not depend on υ and
b. Vector f is given as follows

where Fi = IN+M ⊗¯bi hH

2) Constraint transformation
The radar SNR constraint (30a) can be rewritten as
N+M
X
j=1
wH
k,jgk,igH
k,iwk,j ≥˜Γt,
i ∈˜Qk,
(35)
where ˜Γt =
Γtσ2

t | ˜βk,i|2 . It can be equivalently transformed with
respect to wk as
wH
k GH
i Giwk ≥˜Γt, i ∈˜Qk,
(36)
where Gi = IN+M ⊗gH
k,i.
Noting that constraint (36) is not convex, we apply the
first-order Taylor expansion with respect to wk on (36) and
obtain
wH
k GH
i Giwk ≥−(w(j)
k )HGH
i Giw(j)
k
+ 2Re{(w(j)
k )HGH
i Giwk},
(37)
where w(j)
k
denotes the acquired solution in the j-th itera-
tion. Thus, the original constraint (30a) is transformed into
−(w(j)
k )HGH
i Giw(j)
k
+ 2Re{(w(j)
k )HGH
i Giwk} ≥˜Γt. (38)
To handle CRB constraint (30b), we transform it into the
following constraints based on [54]
C−1 ≤ϵ,

C > 0,
(41)
where C ∈R+ is an introduced auxiliary variable. However,
constraint (40) is still non-convex and very challenging to
handle. To address this challenge, we introduce an auxiliary
variable q ≜[q1, q2, q3]T ∈C3×1 to take Wk out of the
positive semidefinite matrix (PSD) constraint (40), where
qi, i = 1, 2, 3 is expressed as
qi ≜Qi(Wk),
i = 1, 2, 3,
(42)
where Qi(·) denotes the function with respect to Wk based
on the FIM defined in (21) and (22). The detailed definitions
of Qi(·), i = 1, 2, 3, are given in Appendix A.

formed into

To tackle constraints (43f), we formulate the augmented
Lagrangian problem of (43) by introducing the Lagrangian
dual variable Υ ≜[Υ1, Υ2, Υ3]T ∈C3×1 and the penalty
factor ρ > 0 as [55]

(46)
To solve the augmented Lagrangian problem, we first op-
timize the original problem using block coordinate descent
(BCD) in the inner loop and then update the Lagrangian
dual variables and the penalty factor in the outer loop, as
presented below.
a) Update υ and b: For given Wk, Φ(Wk, υ) is convex
with respect to υ. We can obtain the optimal υ∗by setting
∂Φ(υ)/∂υ to zero. Thus, we have

(47)
Note that υ∗
i is equal to the received SINR from BS k at
CU i. Similarly, to obtain the optimal b∗for given Wk
and optimal υ∗, we set ∂Φ(Wk, υ, b)/∂b equal to zero, and
obtain

where the definitions of Θi, i = 1, 2, 3, are given in
Appendix A, and we introduce constants ci ≜−qi+ρΥi, i =
1, 2, 3. The sub-problem is non-convex due to the third term
in (50a). To address this challenge, we apply the MM method
to construct surrogate functions that locally approximate the
objective function and then minimize the surrogate functions.
To start with, we first expand the non-convex term as
|Tr{ΘiWkWH

as

(52)
where ˜Θi ≜¯ci × IN+M ⊗Θi + ci × IN+M ⊗ΘH

is a
Hermitian matrix based on the properties of the Kronecker
product. Therefore, the quadratic form wH

upper-bounded (e.g., similar to Example 13 in [57]) as

(53)
where V ≜λiIM(N+M) ⪰˜Θi with λi being the maximum

denotes the acquired solution in
the j-th iteration. Since ||wk||2

complexity for updating wk via the interior-point method is
in the order of O((M 3.5N 3.5 + M 7)log(1/ε)) [15]. Noting

VI. Simulation Results
A. Simulation System Setup
In this section, we present numerical results to verify the
benefits of the proposed LLM-enabled AO-based algorithm.
In the considered multi-CU multi-BS ISAC network, we
deploy K ISAC BSs with M transmit and receive antennas.
For each ISAC BS k ∈K, there is one target ˜Qk for detection
and one target ˆQk for parameter estimation in the associated
target set Qk. The K ISAC BSs serve N ground CUs. We
consider an area within 200 m × 200 m, where each BS is
spaced between 80 and 160 m. Without loss of generality,
we assume that all ground CUs are uniformly and randomly
distributed, and the associated targets are randomly located
at positions between 100 m and 160 m away from each
ISAC BS. We assume that all the RCS of targets αt,i, ∀i
are randomly generated following CSCG distributions. We
adopt the same initialization method for {Wk}K
k=1 as in
[15] to maximize the sum power of the received signals
of the targets and CUs using the Riemannian conjugate
gradient (RCG) algorithm. The main system parameters are
summarized in Table 1. To evaluate the performance of our
proposed LLM-enabled AO-based algorithm, we consider
the following benchmark schemes for comparison:
• Convex optimization with brute-force search method
(Upper bound, Convex plus BF): This scheme utilizes
the brute-force search to find the optimal UA in Step

• Convex
optimization
with
game
theory
(Convex
method only): This scheme utilizes a low-complexity
game theory-based method to optimize the UA in Step
1 of Algorithm 3. Specifically, this scheme first applies
the Gale-Shapley algorithm [58] to find the initial
matching between CUs and BSs. Then, considering that
CUs may have an incentive for potential transfers from
one heavily loaded base station (BS) to another lightly
loaded BS, we formulate a coalition game based on [59]
to further optimize the user association (UA). The com-
plexity of Step 1 is O(LNK), where L is the number
of iterations. Finally, the BS transmit beamforming is
optimized using Step 2 of Algorithm 3.
• BS

only
(Beamforming only): This scheme only optimizes the
BS transmit beamforming using Step 2 of Algorithm
3, while fixing the UA to the initial matching obtained
by the Gale-Shapley algorithm.

plus GPT-o1): This scheme adopts the proposed LLM-
enabled AO-based algorithm using the GPT-o1 model
as the chosen LLM.
• Proposed Algorithm using the GPT-4-Turbo (Convex

FIGURE 5. Convergence performance of the proposed algorithm.
Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 illustrate the optimized transmit beam-
pattern gains of different BSs with the initial and optimized
UA, respectively, where each BS senses the corresponding
targets and serves the associated CUs. It can be observed that
each BS generates the strongest beams towards the locations
of the targets and associated CUs in both cases. Compared
with the beamforming-only method shown in Fig. 3, the
optimized beampattern gain of each BS from the proposed
algorithm with the GPT-o1 model is much stronger and more
concentrated towards the locations of the targets and CUs,
while the beampattern gains towards other directions are
reduced. Moreover, it is also observed that based on the
proposed algorithm with the GPT-o1 model, BS 1 and BS
2 only serve a single CU, respectively, while BS 3 serves
the rest of the CUs to maximize the overall communication
performance. This demonstrates that our designed prompt
engineering structure effectively guides the GPT-o1 model
to find the optimal UA that maximizes the total sum rate,
which also verifies the effectiveness of our proposed LLM-
enabled AO-based algorithm.
In Fig. 5, we evaluate the convergence performance of
the proposed algorithm compared with other benchmark
schemes. The proposed algorithm with the GPT-o1 model
converges within 10 iterations and achieves exactly the same
performance as the Convex plus BF method, which achieves
a performance upper bound. It is also observed that the
proposed algorithm with the GPT-o1 model outperforms
benchmark schemes using GPT-4-Turbo, Gemini 2.0, and
Claude 3.5 in terms of the convergence speed. This can be
attributed to the powerful reasoning capability of the GPT-
o1 model. With the reasoning steps, GPT-o1 can clearly
understand and efficiently solve the optimization problem
by strictly following the chain of thought prompt. However,
conversation models, including GPT-4-Turbo, Claude-3.5,
and Gemini 2.0, are trained for general language conver-
sations and have difficulty following the reasoning logic in
the prompts and checking the correctness of their problem-
solving logic. It can be concluded that the performance of
the proposed algorithm is largely determined by the chosen
LLM model, and the reasoning model GPT-o1 achieves the
best performance in terms of convergence speed.

FIGURE 6. Average sum rate per CU as a function of the number of CUs
for M = 24 and Pt = 32 dBm.
In Fig. 6, we evaluate the average sum rate per CU as
a function of the number of CUs. As the number of CUs
increases, the average sum rate per CU decreases since more
CUs compete for the limited transmit power and bandwidth
resources. It is observed that compared with other benchmark
schemes, the proposed algorithm with the GPT-o1 model
achieves the best performance in terms of the sum rate per
CU, which is very close to the upper bound for a large
number of CUs. To be more specific, it can be seen that
the proposed algorithm with the GPT-o1 model can generate
optimal results if a small number of CUs are considered.
When the number of CUs increases, the GPT-o1 model
can still generate near-optimal results with the exponential
growth of the UA search space. However, compared with
methods using LLMs, Convex method only scheme can gen-
erate smoother results with a clearer decreasing trend, which
complies with the stability of convex-based optimization
methods. Although the proposed algorithm with the GPT-
4-Turbo model can sometimes outperform other benchmark
methods, the generated results are not good enough and are
VOLUME ,

sometimes even worse than the beamforming-only method.
Similarly, Claude 3.5 and Gemini 2.0 achieve exactly the
same performance, which is not as smooth as that of the Con-
vex method only. First, this is because the sampling mecha-
nisms of LLMs (controlled by, e.g., top-p and temperature)
introduce randomness at each token, which yields diverse
high-probability outputs in repeated runs rather than a single
deterministic solution. Second, the fluctuating performance
of Claude 3.5, Gemini 2.0, and GPT-4-Turbo is largely due
to their general-purpose inference capabilities, which rely on
broad statistical patterns rather than the precise step-by-step
reasoning required for complex combinatorial optimization.
In contrast, reasoning models like GPT-o1 are fine-tuned
with dedicated reasoning capabilities that better navigate
the exponential search space, resulting in more deterministic
outputs. Hence, it can be concluded that the performance of
the proposed algorithm is largely determined by the chosen
LLM model, and the reasoning GPT-o1 model is more likely
to yield deterministic and high-quality solutions compared
with conversation models.

FIGURE 7. Average sum rate as a function of the number of antennas for
N = 10 and Pt = 32 dBm.
In Fig. 7, we evaluate the average sum rate as a function
of the number of antennas. We observe a small performance
gap between the proposed algorithm and other benchmark
methods when the number of antennas is small. This is
because there are not enough DoFs for beamforming to
sense targets and serve CUs. As can be observed, as the
number of antennas increases, the average sum rate increases
since additional antennas can provide more spatial DoFs
for more efficient beamforming. It is also observed that the
proposed algorithm with the GPT-o1 model achieves the
best performance in terms of the sum rate and approaches
the upper bound. Besides, the proposed algorithm with
conversation LLMs still fails to generate the expected results
due to the random output of such LLMs.
In Fig. 8, we evaluate the average sum rate as a function of
the transmit power. It is observed that as the transmit power

increases, the average sum rate also increases because more
power can be allocated to each CU for better communication
performance, which is an obvious and predictable result. In
addition, the proposed algorithm achieves the upper bound
while outperforming other benchmark methods. Compared
with the GPT-o1 model, although the use of conversation
LLMs can sometimes outperform the Convex method only
scheme, such LLMs still fail to generate deterministic and
smooth results due to their stochastic generation process
and limited capabilities in handling complex optimization
problems.

thresholds for N = 10, M = 24, and Pt = 32 dBm
In Fig. 9, we evaluate the average sum rate as a function
of the values of CRB thresholds. We can observe a high-
performance gap for all methods from the CRB threshold
of 0.005 to that of 0.01. This is because such a CRB
threshold of 0.005 is so tight that the BSs are forced to
allocate most of the transmit power for sensing, thus com-

promising the communication performance. There is also a
clear trade-off between communication and sensing. As the
CRB thresholds increase, the average sum rate also increases
since the sensing requirements become looser, and more
power can be allocated for communications. In addition,
the proposed algorithm with the GPT-o1 model reaches the
upper bound while outperforming other benchmark methods.
The proposed algorithm with Gemini 2.0 and Claude 3.5
even generates results worse than the Beamforming only
scheme, which again verifies the benefits of using reasoning
LLMs for the performance of our proposed algorithm.
VII. Conclusions
We considered a multi-BS multi-CU ISAC system and
proposed an LLM-enabled AO-based algorithm to jointly
optimize the multi-BS transmit beamforming and UA strat-
egy to maximize the total communication sum rate while
ensuring the sensing requirements. Firstly, we formulated the
corresponding optimization problem based on appropriate
performance metrics, including the radar SNR for sensing,
CRB for parameter estimation, and downlink sum rate for
communications. Secondly, we decomposed the original
problem into two sub-problems, namely the UA optimiza-
tion and beamforming optimization problems. Thirdly, we
proposed integrating LLMs and convex-based optimization
into an LLM-enabled AO-based algorithm framework to
solve the two sub-problems iteratively. LLMs learn to ef-
ficiently optimize the UA given expert knowledge through
in-context, few-shot, chain of thought, and self-reflection
prompt engineering, which demonstrates the strong and
flexible adaptability of LLMs without extensive training.
Then, the convex-based optimization is used to handle beam-
forming optimization based on the FP, MM, and ADMM
techniques. Finally, our numerical results demonstrated that
the algorithm proposed with the GPT-o1 model achieves a
performance close to the upper bound and outperforms the
Convex method only scheme and other LLM models (GPT-
4-Turbo, Claude 3.5, Gemini 2.0) in terms of total sum rate
and convergence speed, verifying the effectiveness of inte-
grating reasoning LLMs with the convex-based optimization
algorithm framework by combining both of their benefits.
