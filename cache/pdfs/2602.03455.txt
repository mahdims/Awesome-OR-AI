Abstract
Coordinating the movement of multiple autonomous agents over a shared network is a fun-
damental challenge in algorithmic robotics, intelligent transportation, and distributed systems.
The dominant approach, Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF), relies on centralized control and
synchronous collision avoidance, which often requires strict synchronization and guarantees of
globally conflict-free execution. This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Routing under Crossing
Cost model on mixed graphs, a novel framework tailored for asynchronous settings. In our model,
instead of treating conflicts as hard constraints, each agent is assigned a path, and the system
is evaluated through a cost function that measures potential head-on encounters. This “crossing
cost”, which is defined as the product of agents traversing an edge in opposite directions, quantifies
the risk of congestion and delay in decentralized execution.
Our contributions are both game-theoretic and algorithmic. We model the setting as a con-
gestion game with a non-standard cost function, prove the existence of pure Nash equilibria, and
analyze the dynamics leading to them. Equilibria can be found in polynomial time under mild
conditions, while the general case is PLS-complete. From an optimization perspective, deciding
whether a solution with zero crossing cost exists generalizes the Steiner Orientation problem, mak-
ing the problem NP-complete. To address this hardness barrier, we design a suite of parameter-
ized algorithms for minimizing crossing cost, with parameters including the number of arcs, edges,
agents, and structural graph measures such as vertex cover. These yield XP or FPT results de-
pending on the parameter, offering algorithmic strategies for structurally restricted instances. Our
framework provides a new theoretical foundation for decentralized multi-agent routing, bridging
equilibrium analysis and parameterized complexity to support scalable and risk-aware coordina-
tion.

Introduction
Coordinating the movement of multiple autonomous agents over a shared network is a fundamen-
tal challenge in algorithmic robotics, intelligent transportation, and distributed systems. A central
abstraction for this task is the Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem, which has numerous
real-world applications, e.g., in warehouse management, autonomous vehicle coordination, and multi-
robot systems [23, 31, 32]. In MAPF, the goal is to compute collision-free paths that prevent agents
from simultaneously occupying the same vertex or traversing the same edge in opposite directions.
The canonical MAPF formulation typically assumes centralized control, synchronized movement, and
tight coordination to enforce these constraints, with the primary objective being the minimization of
makespan or total cost.

In contrast, many real-world multi-agent systems, such as fleets of delivery robots, autonomous ve-
hicles on road networks, or agents in communication-limited environments, operate with asynchronous
timing and decentralized decision-making. In such settings, it is often impractical to enforce strict
synchronization or guarantee globally conflict-free execution. Instead, agents may be provided with
routes (that is, sequences of vertices to be followed), while the precise timing of their execution re-
mains unspecified. Consequently, potential conflicts are better viewed not as hard constraints but as
quantifiable risks arising from route interactions.
A powerful and well-studied framework for modeling such scenarios is the class of network conges-
tion games, introduced by Rosenthal [27]. In these games, each agent has a pair of vertices: a source
and a destination. Each agent then selfishly selects a path between its source and destination on a
network to minimize a cost function based on edge congestion, typically defined as a non-decreasing
function of the number of agents traversing an edge. This formulation reflects situations where agents
operate independently and may interact only partially or unpredictably during execution. It is well-
known that network congestion games are guaranteed to possess a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium [27].
While finding such an equilibrium is PLS-complete in general [1, 15], it is tractable in specific cases,
such as when all agents share the same source-terminal pair [15].
In this work, we introduce a novel congestion game model, which we call Crossing Cost Multi-
Agent Routing (CC-MAR). Unlike traditional network congestion games, the cost is incurred not
by the total number of agents on an edge, but only by those traversing it in opposite directions; only
potential head-on encounters are penalized. This asymmetric cost structure reflects practical scenarios
such as unidirectional flow in narrow corridors or lanes, where same-direction usage is typically non-
disruptive. Figure 1 shows an example of our model.

Figure 1: An example of CC-MAR. In this example, there are 4 agents with terminal pairs (v11, v15),
(v35, v12), (v31, v35), and (v33, v34), respectively. The strategy of each agent is Pi for i ∈{1, 2, 3, 4}.
Path P1 and path P2 cross each other on the edge {v12, v13}. Thus, the crossing cost between P1 and
P2 is 1. The individual cost of agent 1 is also 1, as it has no other crossings. On the other hand, the
individual cost of agent 2 is 4. This is because it crosses P1 on edge {v12, v13}, crosses P3 on edges
{v33, v34}, {v34, v35}, and crosses P4 on edge {v34, v35}. The total cost of the strategy profile is the
sum of all pairwise crossing costs, which is 1(from P1, P2) + 2(from P2, P3) + 1(from P2, P4) = 4.
1.1
Our contribution
We investigate CC-MAR model from both a game-theoretic and an algorithmic perspectives. Table
1 summarizes our contributions.
From a game-theoretic perspective, we analyze the strategic behavior of agents who selfishly choose
their own routes to minimize their individual crossing costs. In this setting, we first establish that the
game always has a (pure) Nash equilibrium and prove that best-response dynamics are guaranteed to
converge in at most wmaxk2m steps, where wmax is the maximum weight among edges. This result
stems from our proof that any strategy profile with minimum cost is a Nash equilibrium, which implies
that the Price of Stability (PoS) is 1. In stark contrast, we demonstrate an instance where the Price
of Anarchy (PoA) is unbounded. Next, we consider the complexity of finding a Nash equilibrium,
showing that it can be solved in polynomial time if the weights are bounded by a polynomial in the
input size, but becomes PLS-complete otherwise.

Shifting to a centralized optimization perspective, we study the problem of finding a minimum-cost
strategy profile, referred to as an optimal solution. We first observe that our problem generalizes the
Steiner Orientation problem. Specifically, deciding whether a zero-cost solution exists is equivalent
to solving an instance of the Steiner Orientation problem. Since Steiner Orientation is known to be
NP-complete in very restricted graph classes [20], so is finding an optimal solution for CC-MAR. To
circumvent this hardness, we employ the framework of parameterized complexity.
Our analysis yields a comprehensive suite of parameterized algorithms. We first present an XP
algorithm parameterized by the number of terminal pairs k. We next develop two FPT algorithms:
one parameterized by the number of edges, and another by the number of arcs plus the number of
terminal pairs. We then proceed by considering more restricted instances, with particular interest in
unweighted graphs. Here, we establish the fixed-parameter tractability for the combined parameter of
vertex cover number plus the number of terminal pairs. We also deal with even more restricted cases,
such as instances without overlapping terminal vertices.
Crucially, many of our algorithmic results are provably tight, as they are constrained by existing
hardness results for Steiner Orientation.
The W[1]-hardness of Steiner Orientation parameterized
by the number of terminal pairs [5] implies that our XP algorithm is unlikely to be improved to
FPT. Additionally, since Steiner Orientation is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the vertex cover
number [20], we do not expect to achieve fixed-parameter tractability with respect to the vertex cover
number alone.
Taken together, our results provide both deep algorithmic insights and a structural understanding of
multi-agent routing under asymmetric interaction costs, contributing to the design of more robust and
scalable, decentralized coordination mechanisms for systems where strict synchronization is infeasible.

Related work
Our model is at the intersection of Multi-Agent Path Finding, Congestion Games, and Graph Orien-
tation. In this section, we introduce related work in these lines.
Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF)
Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) has received significant
attention from both theoretical and practical perspectives, with many real-world applications, e.g., in
warehouse management, autonomous vehicle coordination, and multi-robot systems [23,25,26,28,31,
32]. A significant body of work aims to overcome the computational hardness of MAPF by considering
restricted instances and parameterized complexity [11, 14, 16, 18]. Additionally, several variations of
MAPF have been introduced over the years addressing concepts like energy consumption [10], commu-
nication constraints [17,30], rescheduling after delays [22], and many others [2,24,29,33]. In contrast to
classical MAPF, which models synchronous systems with hard collision constraints, our work focuses
on asynchronous systems with a soft cost function. As such, CC-MAR provides a more flexible and
arguably more realistic model for decentralized systems where timing is uncertain.
Congestion Games
The Congestion Game is first introduced by Rosenthal [27]. In a standard
congestion game, players select from a set of shared resources, and the cost associated with each
resource depends on the number of players using it. Rosenthal proves that every congestion game
admits a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium by employing a potential function argument.
The CC-MAR model is most closely related to Network Congestion Games, where graph edges act
as the resources. In this setting, the strategy for a player with a terminal pair (s, t) is to choose an
s-t path. The total cost for a player is the sum of the costs of the edges in their chosen path, where
an edge’s cost is a non-decreasing function of the number of agents using it. A Nash equilibrium can
be computed in polynomial time if all players share the same terminal pair [15], but finding one is
PLS-complete in the general case [1,15].
Steiner Orientation
The zero-cost version of CC-MAR is equivalent to the Steiner Orientation
problem, where one must orient undirected edges in a mixed graph to connect a set of terminal pairs.
This problem is NP-complete, even on graphs of treewidth 2 [3,20]. From a parameterized perspective,
its complexity is well-understood: the problem is FPT when parameterized by the number of edges
and arcs, but it is W[1]-hard (though in XP) when parameterized by the number of terminal pairs
or the vertex cover number [6,9,20]. These hardness results for Steiner Orientation apply directly to
CC-MAR.

Notations and Problem Setting.
Let G = (V, E, A) be a mixed graph, where E ⊆
 V


denotes
the set of (undirected) edges in G and A ⊆V ×V denotes the set of directed edges in G. An undirected
edge is called just an edge, and a directed edge is called an arc. If each edge e ∈E has the weight we,
the graph G is called a weighted graph. Throughout the paper, we assume that the edge weights are
positive integers.
A sequence of vertices v1 −. . . −vm is a path in G if i, j ∈[m] if i ̸= j then vi ̸= vj, and for any
i ∈[m −1], either {vi, vi+1} ∈E or (vi, vi+1) ∈A.
We say that paths P1 and P2 use an edge {u, v} ∈E in opposite directions if u and v appear
consecutively in both paths and u precedes v in P1 if and only if v precedes u in P2. We define the
crossing cost cost(P1, P2) as the sum of weights wuv of edges {u, v} ∈E that are used in opposite
directions by P1 and P2.
For each edge e = {u, v} ∈E, we define −→e = (u, v) and ←−e = (v, u). Let x−
→
e (resp., x←
−
e ) be the
number of agents on −→e (resp., ←−e ) in P. Without loss of generality, we assume that a path P uses
−→e = (u, v) if it uses edge e = {u, v}. We denote by E(P) the set of edges used by a path P.
Given a set of paths P = {P1, . . . , Pk}, the cost of a path Pi is defined as:
costP(Pi) =

Our model is formally defined as follows.
Crossing Cost Multi-Agent Routing (CC-MAR)
Input: Γ = (G, T ) where G = (V, E, A) is a (weighted) mixed graph, T is a multiset that
contains k pairs of vertices (si, ti) ∈V × V , i ∈[k].

We say Γ = (G, T ) is feasible if there exists at least one si-ti path in G for each i ∈[k]. In this
paper, we assume that Γ is feasible because we can check whether Γ is feasible in polynomial time
by computing an si-ti path for i ∈[k] on the directed graph obtained by replacing each edge {u, v}
in E by directed arcs (u, v) and (v, u). When we deal with the optimization version of CC-MAR, a
strategy profile will be called a feasible solution, while the feasible solution of minimum total cost will
be called an optimal solution.
Parametrized Complexity.
As we have already mentioned, we will result to parameterized com-
plexity in order to overcome the tractability hardness of computing optimal solutions of CC-MAR.
Parameterized complexity extends classical complexity analysis by introducing a secondary metric
called the parameter. Under this framework, the problems are defined as pairs (x, k) ∈Σ∗× N, where
k is the parameter. The goal is to capture all the computational hardness in the parameter and pro-
vide algorithms that scale well as the input grows. In particular, a problem admits a fixed-parameter
tractable algorithm (FPT) if it is solvable in f(k)|x|O(1) time (for a computable function f). Similarly,
a problem admits a slicewise polynomial (XP) algorithm if it is solvable in |x|f(k) time. Problems that
admit FPT algorithms belong to the complexity class FPT while problems that admit XP algorithms
belong to the XP class. Under standard computational complexity assumptions problems proven W[1]-
hard (via parameterized reduction) do not belong to FPT while problems proven ParaNP-hard (via
parameterized reduction) do not belong to XP. We refer to the monographs [8,13,19] for a dedicated
study of parameterized complexity.

Game Theoretic Results
In this section, we investigate Nash Equilibria on CC-MAR.
3.1
Existence and convergence of a Nash equilibrium
Theorem 1. A Nash equilibrium always exists, and the Nash dynamics converge with at most wmaxk2|E|
steps, where wmax is the maximum weight among edges.
Proof. We show that cost(P) is a valid potential function. Let P be the set of si-ti paths P1, . . . , Pk.
For each edge e = {u, v} ∈E, we define −→e = (u, v) and ←−e = (v, u). Let x−
→
e (resp., x←
−
e ) be the number
of agents on −→e (resp., ←−e ) in P. Then the cost of P is denoted by cost(P) = P
e∈E wex−
→
e x←
−
e .
If P is not a Nash equilibrium, there exists an agent i that wants to change its path Pi to a path
P ′
i whose cost is less than Pi. Let P′ = {P1, . . . , P ′
i, . . . , Pk}. Without loss of generality, we assume
that whenever Pi uses an edge u, v ∈E, it does so in the direction −→e = (u, v). We categorize edges
with respect to the difference between Pi and P ′
i:
• E−
→i denotes the set of edges used by only Pi, i.e., E(Pi) \ E(P ′
i). Without loss of generality,
suppose Pi uses −→e .
5


--- Page 6 ---
• E←
−i denotes the set of edges used by only P ′
i, i.e., E(P ′
i) \ E(Pi). Also, suppose P ′
i uses ←−e .
• Fi denotes the set of edges used by both Pi and P ′
i in the same direction. Also, suppose both Pi
and P ′
i use −→e .
• Ri denotes the set of edges used by both Pi and P ′
i in the different directions. Also, suppose Pi
uses −→e and P ′
i uses ←−e .
• ˆEi denotes the set of edges used by neither Pi nor P ′
i, i.e., E \ (E(Pi) ∪E(P ′
i)).
Then the total cost of P can be represented as follows:
cost(P) =
X

→
i ⊎E←

i ⊎Fi⊎Ri⊎ˆ

On the other hand, since

e x−

e +
X

we have:

e −1)
= cost(P′) −cost(P).
By assumption that costP′(P ′
i)−costP(Pi) < 0, cost(P′)−cost(P) < 0 holds, implying that cost(P)
is the potential function. Since the maximum cost of a strategy profile is at most wmaxk2|E|, the Nash
dynamics converge at most wmaxk2|E| steps.
3.2
Price of anarchy and price of stability
Theorem 2. The price of stability is 1.
Proof.
By the proof of Theorem 1, the minimum cost solution is a Nash equilibrium.
Theorem 3. The price of anarchy is unbounded even for monotone edge costs.
Proof. Let G = ({a, b, c}, {{a, b}, {b, c}, {c, a}} be a complete graph with three vertices. There are two
agents on each vertex and we denote them by A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2. The terminal vertices of A1,
A2, B1, B2, C1, C2 are b, c, c, a, a, b, respectively.
Let P1 be a strategy profile as follows: PA1 = a −b, PA2 = a −c, PB1 = b −c, PB2 = b −a,
PC1 = c −a, and PC2 = c −b. Under P1, the cost of each agent is 1. Moreover, it is easily seen that
each agent cannot reduce its cost by changing the current path. Thus, P1 is a Nash equilibrium, and
the cost of P1 is 6.
Next, consider the following strategy profile P2 as follows: PA1 = a−b, PA2 = a−b−c, PB1 = b−c,
PB2 = b−c−a, PC1 = c−a, PC2 = c−a−b. Then the cost of P2 is 0. Therefore, the price of anarchy
is unbounded.
3.3
Computing a Nash equilibrium
Theorem 4. Given a strategy profile P, one can determine whether P is a Nash equilibrium in
O(k(|E| log wmax + |V | log |V |)). Furthermore, if P is not a Nash equilibrium, an improving path can
be found in the same running time.
6


--- Page 7 ---
Proof. Let G = (V, E, A) be an input graph. Given a strategy profile P, we verify for each agent i
whether it has an incentive to change the current path Pi. To do this, we define the directed graph
G′ = (V, A′) obtained from G by replacing (undirected) edges in E with bidirectional arcs. For each
arc (u, v) ∈A′, we set the weight w′
uv as follows:
w′
uv =





wuv(xvu −1)
(if vu ∈Pi and {u, v} ∈E)
wuvxvu
(if vu /∈Pi and {u, v} ∈E)
0
(otherwise)
Let P ′
i be a shortest si-ti path in G′. We can see that the weight of the path P ′
i in G′ is equal to the
cost of the path P ′
i for agent i when it changes its strategy to P ′
i. Therefore, if the weight of P ′
i in G′
is less than the cost costP(Pi) of the path Pi under P, agent i has an incentive to change, and P ′
i is an
improving path for agent i. On the other hand, if there is no such path, any other si-ti path is at least
as costly as Pi when the paths of other agents are fixed, and hence agent i has no incentive to change
its path. If any agent has no improving path, then P is a Nash equilibrium. Since the edge weights can
be set in time O(|E| log wmax) and a shortest si-ti path can be computed in time O(|E| + |V | log |V |),
one can verify whether P is a Nash equilibrium in time O(k(|E| log wmax + |V | log |V |)).
From Theorem 1 and Theorem 4, we obtain the following corollary.

At the end of this section, we prove that finding a Nash equilibrium is PLS-complete by showing
a PLS-reduction from the Quadratic Threshold Game (QTG), which is PLS-complete [1].
Theorem 5. Finding a Nash equilibrium in CC-MAR is PLS-complete.
From Theorem 4, finding a Nash equilibrium in weighted CC-MAR is in PLS. To show the PLS-
hardness, we introduce the Quadratic Threshold Game (QTG), which is a special case of congestion
games.
Let B = {1, . . . , n} be the set of n agents. Let R = Rin ∪Rout be a set, called a resource set where
Rin ∩Rout = ∅, and Rin = {rij | i, j ∈B} and Rout = {ri | i ∈B}. That is, resource ri is used by
only agent i. If i uses ri, it takes cost Ti, called threshold. An element rij ∈Rin is a resource for
i, j ∈B. Thus, rij is used by i or j, or both. The cost of rij is defined by a nondecreasing function
cij : {0, 1, 2} →Z≥0 depending on the number of agents xrij ∈{0, 1, 2} using rij. Here, Z≥0 denotes
the set of nonnegative integers.
Each agent i has two strategies Sout
i
= {ri} where ri ∈Rout and Sin
i = {rij | rij ∈Rin, j ∈B, i ̸= j}.
By the above definition, when i chooses strategy Sout
i
, then the cost of i is Ti, and when i chooses
strategy Sin
i , then the cost of i is P
j∈B,j̸=i cij(xrij). Therefore, a quadratic threshold game is denoted
by ∆= (B, {Ti | i ∈B}, {cij | i, j ∈B, i ̸= j})
Here, every agent can see other agents’ strategies and prefers a less expensive strategy. For example,
if the cost of choosing Sin
i
is less than the current cost of choosing Sout
i
, then agent i has an incentive
to change its strategy.
If any agent has no incentive to change, such a strategy profile is a Nash
equilibrium.
[1] shows that a Nash equilibrium on quadratic threshold games is PLS-complete.
Theorem 6 ( [1]). Finding a Nash equilibrium on quadratic threshold games with non-decreasing cost
functions is PLS-complete under the following assumption.
• for each pair i and j, the cost function cij satisfies cij(0) = cij(1) = 0 and cij(2) ∈Z≥0, and
• for each i, the threshold Ti is positive.
Thus, it is sufficient to show that any quadratic threshold game ∆= (B, {Ti | i ∈B}, {cij | i, j ∈
B}) can be PLS-reduced to some instance of a CC-MAR Γ = (G, T ). Our reduction presented here
modifies a part of the reduction from QTG to a network congestion game in [1].
Proof of Theorem 5. Given a QTG ∆= (B, {Ti | i ∈B}, {cij | i, j ∈B}) with n = |B| agents, we
construct a grid-like graph as shown in Figure 2. This graph consists of a grid section with vertices

oriented downwards and horizontal arcs are oriented from left to right. We denote by vij the vertex
placed in ith row and jth column. Moreover, the graph has arcs from vi1 to vni for each i ∈[n]. We
call the arc (vi1, vni) the threshold arcs of agent i.
We then define n agents p1, . . . , pn, called main agents. Their terminal pairs are given (si, ti) =
(vi1, vni) for i ∈[n]. Intuitively, each agent i has two strategy: the threshold arc (si, ti) of i and the
row-column path from si to ti, which first passes along horizontal arcs of row i until column i and then
goes down to ti along vertical arcs in column i. The selection of these two paths corresponds to the
selection of Sout
i
and Sin
i
in the QTC.
To enforce each agent to choose either its threshold arc or its row-column path, we additionally
modify the instance. First, we replace each horizontal arc and threshold arc (u, v) by a mixed u-v path
consisting of (u, u′), {u′, v′}, (v′, v) as shown in Figure 3. Let D be a large integer. If an arc (u, v) is a
horizontal arc in ith row, we define the weight of edge {u′, v′} as wu′v′ = D · i. If an arc (u, v) is the
threshold arc, we define the weight of edge {u′, v′} as wu′v′ = D·i·(i−1)+Ti. Moreover, we introduce
an agent av′u′ with its terminal pair (v′, u′) for each edge {u′, v′}. Note that by the construction, the
agent av′u′ always chooses the path ⟨v′, u′⟩as its strategy.
Finally, to simulate the cost of the resource rij, for 1 ≤i < j ≤n, we split vertex vij into two
vertices v(1)
ij and v(2)
ij and add edge {v(1)
ij , v(2)
ij } with weight cij. Incoming arcs to vij are incident to v(1)
ij
and outgoing arcs from vij are incident to v(2)
ij . We then introduce agent aij whose terminal pair is
(v(2)
ij , v(1)
ij ). Similarly to av′u′, the strategy of aij is only the path ⟨v(2)
ij , v(1)
ij ⟩. We call this replacement
part the resource gadget of rij (see Figure 4). As for the terminal pair of agent pi for 2 ≤i ≤n, we
set (si, ti) = (v(1)
i1 , v(1)
ni ). The terminal pair of agent p1 is set as (s1, t1) = (v11, v(1)
n1 ). Since D is a
sufficiently large integer, each agent pi has only two strategies: the threshold arc (si, ti) of i and the
row-column path from si to ti, which first passes along horizontal arcs of row i until column i and
then goes down to ti along vertical arcs in column i.
The cost of the threshold path for i is clearly D · i · (i −1) + Ti. The cost of the row-column path
for i is the sum of costs from the i horizontal undirected edges and the resource gadgets it traverses,
which equals D · i · (i −1) + P
j∈B,j̸=i cij(xrij) where xrij ∈{0, 1, 2} represents the number of uses
for the resource gadget of rij. Indeed, if agent i chooses the row-column path, it crosses agents in
horizontal undirected edges and several main agents who also choose their row-column paths in the
resource gadgets. Note that the cost function cij satisfies that cij(0) = cij(1) = 0 and cij(2) ∈Z≥0.
Consequently, for each agent i, its strategy Sout
i
in the QTG ∆can be mapped one-to-one with the
threshold arc of i in the weighted CC-MAR Γ, and its strategy Sin
i
corresponds to the row-column

path of i. Furthermore, we can easily see that a strategy profile in the QTG ∆is a Nash equilibrium
if and only if a strategy profile P in the weighted CC-MAR Γ is a Nash equilibrium. Therefore, our
construction is a PLS-reduction from QTG to weighted CC-MAR.

Minimum-Cost Solution via Parameterization
Hereafter, we consider the problem of finding a minimum-cost strategy profile (i.e., an optimal solu-
tion). Before presenting our main results, we establish key observations used throughout this and the
next section.
Cycles
We can always assume that G has no cycles. If this is not the case, we repeatedly contract
a mixed cycle C to a single vertex, while such a cycle exists. Finding such cycles can be done in
polynomial time using the classic DFS algorithm [7]. Eventually, we obtain the resulting graph G′ =
(V ′, E′, A′) having no mixed cycles. This procedure is safe since any agent moving from u ∈C to
v ∈C could move within C without cost. Hereafter, we assume that G is acyclic, and therefore, G[A]
is a DAG and G[E] is a forest.
Pendant vertices
We can always assume that the given graph does not have any pendant vertices
i.e., vertices of degree 1. In particular, we show how to deal with pendant vertices, before we delete
them.
Note that any pendant vertex without a terminal is redundant, as it is never used in any path (its
usage would result in a walk instead). Therefore, it can be removed.
Now, consider a pendant vertex v that appears as a terminal. Let u be the unique neighbor of v in
G. If {u, v} /∈E, then v is incident to an arc. Since arcs do not affect the cost of the solution, and a
feasible solution exists (by assumption), we can replace all appearances of v in T with u and remove
v.
Next, we consider the case where {u, v} ∈E. If v appears only as a source or only as a sink
terminal, then the edge {u, v} is used either only from v to u, or only from u to v. Therefore, it does
not affect the cost, and we can safely replace all appearances of v in T with u and remove v.
Now, assume that v appears in T both as a source and as a sink terminal. Let ℓs and ℓt be the
number of times v appears as a source and as a sink terminal, respectively. Since we assume that
no pair (v, v) ∈T , any feasible solution includes ℓs paths that use {u, v} to go from v to u, and ℓt
paths that use {u, v} to go from u to v. Also, no other path uses the edge {u, v}. This gives a cost
of ℓs · ℓt. Therefore, we can replace all appearances of v in T with u, remove v, and adjust the cost
appropriately (i.e., either set the cost as ℓ−ℓs · ℓt in the decision version, or increase the cost by ℓs · ℓt
after computing a solution of the new instance).
From the above, we establish a key observation.
Observation 1 (Input Simplification). Without loss of generality, the input graph can be assumed to
be acyclic and free of degree-1 vertices.
Identical terminal pairs
Recall that in the definition, we have allowed the same pair to appear
multiple times in T . This is important, as having identical terminal pairs multiple times affects the
9


--- Page 10 ---
cost and may lead to completely different optimal solutions depending on the number of times each
pair appears.
In this part, we prove that regardless of how many times a pair appears, there exists an optimal
solution in which all identical pairs use exactly the same path to connect their terminals. To prove
this, consider an instance (G, T ) and an optimal solution P such that:
• There exist two terminal pairs (si, ti) = (sj, tj), where 0 < i < j ≤k, and
• the si-ti and sj-tj paths in the optimal solution are Pi, Pj ∈P with Pi ̸= Pj.
We will show that we can select one of the paths Pi or Pj and replace both with the selected one.
Let P = Pi. Note that cost(P \ Pi) = cost(P \ Pj). Indeed, if cost(P \ Pi) < cost(P \ Pj) or
cost(P \ Pi) > cost(P \ Pj), then the feasible solution (P \ {Pj}) ∪{Pi} or (P \ {Pi}) ∪{Pj} would
have smaller cost than P, contradicting optimality.
Finally, note that (P \ {Pj}) ∪{Pi} must have the same cost as P, and therefore, there exists a
solution in which (si, ti) and (sj, tj) are connected by identical paths.
We can easily generalize this to any number of identical pairs by repeating the same process several
times.
Observation 2 (Solution Structure). For any CC-MAR instance (G, T ), there exists a minimum-cost
solution where identical terminal pairs are connected by identical paths.
Parameterization by the number of vertices
We present a fixed-parameter tractable (FPT)
algorithm parameterized by the number of vertices |V |. This algorithm serves as a subroutine for
several methods introduced later in the paper.
Proposition 1. A minimum-cost solution for a CC-MAR instance (G, T ) can be computed in time
|V |O(|V |3)kO(1).
Proof. The set T is a multiset. Let T ′ be the set of terminal pairs obtained from T after removing
duplicates. Let (s′
i, t′
i) be an enumeration of the terminal pairs in T ′, and let ki be the number of
times (s′
i, t′
i) appears in T . Note that ki ≥1 for all i ∈|T ′|.
Recall that Observation 2 showed that there exists an optimal solution of (G, T ) where, for all
i ∈|T ′|, all ki copies of (s′
i, t′
i) use exactly the same path.
Note that, if we are given a path Pi for each i ∈|T ′| such that Pi is an s′
i-t′
i path in G, we can
compute the cost of a feasible solution where only these paths are used to connect the terminal pairs,
in polynomial time. Indeed, the cost of such a feasible solution is:
X
0<i<j≤|T ′|
ki · kj · cost(Pi, Pj)
where cost(Pi, Pj) can be computed in polynomial time, and |T ′| ≤|V (G)|2. Therefore, we just need
to compute which paths are used by each terminal pair in T ′.
Fix a pair (s′, t′) ∈T ′. Note that there exist at most 2|V (G)| · |V (G)|! different paths between s′
and t′. Indeed, we can enumerate all of them by guessing which vertices belong to Pi and the order in
which they appear. This also gives us the upper bound on the number of paths.
Therefore, in order to compute an optimal solution of (G, T ), it suffices to:
• guess, for each pair (s′
i, t′
i) ∈T ′, the path that its copies will use,
• compute the cost of the guessed paths, and,
• return the guess of minimum cost.
Since we have at most |V (G)|2 pairs in T ′, the number of guesses is bounded by |V (G)|O(|V (G)|3).
Since the rest of the computations can be done in polynomial time, the algorithm runs in time
|V (G)|O(|V (G)|3)(|V (G)| + k)O(1).

Parameterized by the number of agents
Theorem 7. An minimum-cost solution for a CC-MAR instance (G, T ) can be computed in time
|V |O(k2)kO(1).
Proof. The strategy is as follows: (1) We prove a structural property that in an optimal solution, any
pair of agents cross each other on at most one undirected path, (2) We guess these crossing interactions
for all O(k2) pairs of agents, and (3) For each guess, we reduce the problem of finding the remaining
non-crossing paths to Steiner Orientation.
Claim 1. In a minimum-cost solution P∗, any pair of agents crosses on at most one undirected path
within G[E].
Proof of the claim.
Suppose for contradiction that agents i and j cross on at least two disjoint
undirected paths, Q1 and Q2, in G[E]. Let Pi and Pj be their respective paths in P∗. Assume that
along Pi, the crossing on Q1 occurs before the crossing on Q2. Let (u1, v1) and (u2, v2) be the endpoints
of Q1 and Q2, respectively. Without loss of generality, we assume Pi traverses Q1 from u1 to v1 and
Q2 from u2 to v2. Thus, Pi has the structure si ⇝u1 ⇝v1 ⇝u2 ⇝v2 ⇝ti. Correspondingly, Pj
must traverse Q1 from v1 to u1 and Q2 from v2 to u2.
There are two fundamental ways for Pj to connect these segments, as shown in Figure 5.
Case 1: Pj is of the form sj ⇝v1 ⇝u1 ⇝v2 ⇝u2 ⇝tj. Let P ′
i be the directed subpath of Pi from
v1 to u2, and P ′
j be the directed subpath of Pj from u1 to v2. We can reroute the agents by swapping
these directed subpaths, creating new paths P ∗
i = si ⇝u1
P ′
j
⇝v2 ⇝ti and P ∗
j = sj ⇝v1
P ′
i
⇝u2 ⇝tj.
In this new solution, agents i and j no longer cross on Q1 or Q2. Since the rerouting occurs only on
directed subpaths (where no costs are incurred), no new costs are introduced, but the two original
crossing costs on Q1 and Q2 are eliminated. This yields a new solution with a strictly lower total cost,
which contradicts the optimality of P∗.
Case 2: Pj is of the form sj ⇝v2 ⇝u2 ⇝v1 ⇝u1 ⇝tj. In this case, the path segments form
a mixed cycle v1 ⇝u2 ⇝v1, which contradicts a standard assumption that the graph has no mixed
cycles.
Therefore, any pair of agents crosses on at most one undirected path in G[E].
⋄
Based on Claim 1, our algorithm can guess all crossing interactions. For each of the
 k
2

= O(k2)
pairs of agents, we guess (a) whether they cross, and (b) if so, on which path in G[E] they cross. Since
G[E] is a forest, a path is uniquely defined by its endpoints. The number of possible paths to guess
for each agent pair is bounded by O(|V |2). Thus, the total number of guesses is |V |O(k2).
For a fixed guess of all crossing interactions, we must determine the full path for each agent.
This involves not only the specified undirected crossing paths but also the order in which each agent
traverses them. This ordering can also be guessed, contributing a factor of at most (k −1)! for each
agent, which is absorbed into the |V |O(k2) term.
With a fixed guess (including the ordering of crossings for each agent), the problem is reduced to
finding a set of non-crossing directed paths. For each agent i, we need to connect their terminal si to
the entry of their first crossing path, connect the exit of one crossing path to the entry of the next,
11


--- Page 12 ---
and connect the exit of the last crossing path to ti. This is an instance of Steiner Orientation.
The set of terminal pairs for this subproblem, T ′, has size O(k2).
If the Steiner Orientation instance returns a solution, we construct the full path Pi for each
agent. The Steiner Orientation subproblem can be solved in |V |O(|T ′|) = |V |O(k2) time [9]. The
total runtime is the number of guesses multiplied by the time for verification: |V |O(k2) · |V |O(k2) =
|V |O(k2). We finally return the valid guess of the minimum cost.
4.2
Parameterized by number of edges
Theorem 8. A minimum-cost solution for a CC-MAR instance (G, T ) can be computed in time
22O(|E|)(k|V |)O(1).
Proof. We reduce an instance (G, T ) to an equivalent instance (G′, T ′) whose size is bounded by a
function of |E|, and this reduction is performed in FPT time by |E|.
We construct the reduced graph G′ = (V ′, E′, A′). Let VE ⊆V be the set of endpoints of the
undirected edges in E and let r = |VE| be the number of vertices incident to undirected edges. Note
that r = |VE| ≤2|E|. We then prepare two vertex sets S′ = {s′
U | U ⊆VE} and T = {t′
U | U ⊆VE},
which are associated with the subsets of VE.The vertex set of G′ is defined as V ′ = VE ∪S′ ∪T ′. The
edge set E′ of G′ is the same as E, i.e., E′ = E. We also define the arc set A′
E such that (u, v) ∈A′
E
where u, v ∈VE if and only if a directed path from u to v exists in the directed subgraph G −E
obtained by removing all edges from G. Finally, we connect S′ with VE and T ′ with VE, respectively.
For each vertex sU ∈S′, we add arcs to vertices in U ⊆VE. Similarly, we add arcs from vertices in
U ⊆VE to tU ∈T ′. We denote by A′
S′ and A′
T ′ the set of arcs from S′ to VE and VE to T ′, respectively,
and define A′ = A′
E ∪A′
S′ ∪A′
T ′. The constructed graph G′ has at most r + 2 · 2r vertices, at most
r2 edges, and at most 2r+1r + r2 arcs. Since the reachability check can be computed in O(|G|), the
graph G′ can be constructed in time 2O(r)|G|.
The new terminal pairs T ′ are defined on G′. For each original agent i, the new start terminal is
sU ∈S′ where U is the set of vertices in VE such that si ∈V can reach in G −E. Similarly, the new
end terminal is tU ∈T ′ where U is the set of vertices in VE that can reach ti ∈V in G −E. Since
defining new terminal pairs is done in time 2O(r)k|V |O(1), the total running time for constructing the
new instance is 2O(r)k|V |O(1).
New instance (G′, T ′) is equivalent to the original. A path in G corresponds to a path in G′ by
contracting its directed segments into single arcs, and vice versa. Since crossing costs only occur on
the undirected edges E, which are common to both graphs, the cost of any solution is preserved.
Since the number of vertices in G′ is at most 2O(r), by Proposition 1, a minimum-cost solution can
be found in time 22O(r)kO(1). Therefore, the total running time is 22O(|E|)(k|V |)O(1).
4.3
Parameterized by number of arcs plus k
Theorem 9. A minimum-cost solution for a CC-MAR instance (G, T ) can be computed in time
|A|O(k|A|)|V |O(1).
Proof. Consider any path P in G. We will say that P has the path form a1, . . . , am if {ai | i ∈[m]} is
the set of arcs appearing in P and, for any 0 < i < j ≤m, ai appear before aj, while moving through
P.
Note that, we have at most 2|A||A|! possible path forms. Additionally, given a terminal pair (si, ti)
and a path form a1, . . . , am, we can check in polynomial time if there exists an si −ti path that has
the given form. Indeed, this can be done by verifying that the following three conditions hold:
1. Either a1 = (si, v), for some v ∈V or a1 = (u, v) and there exists an si −u path G −A.
2. Either am = (u, ti) for some u ∈V or am = (u, v) and there exists an v −ti path G −A.
3. For all i ∈[m −1], either ai = (u, v) and ai+1 = (v, w) for some u, w ∈V or ai = (u, v),
ai+1 = (v′, w) and there exists an v −v′ path G −A.
We proceed by guessing the path form of each si −ti path in an optimal solution. This give us
2k|A|(|A|!)k possible guesses. Since it is easy to check the validity of our guesses, we can assume that
we keep only the valid ones.
We proceed by defining a sub-problem called Pre-Described CC-MAR.
12


--- Page 13 ---
Input: An instance (G, T ) of CC-MAR. Additionally, for each (si, ti) ∈T path form ai
1, . . . , ai
mi and
an integer ℓ.
Question: Are there k paths Pi such that, for all i ∈k, Pi is an si-ti path with path form ai
1, . . . , ai
mi
and cost({P1, . . . , Pk}) is at most ℓ.
Claim 2. Pre-Described CC-MARcan be solved in polynomial time.
Proof of the claim. We just need to find the minimum cost way to complete the path forms using only
undirected edges. To do so we create the following instance:
For each pair (si, ti) let ai
1, . . . , ai
mi be the path form of the si −ti path we search. We create a set
of terminal pairs that will replace (si, ti) as follows:
• if ai
1 = (u, v) and u ̸= si we create the pair (si, u)
• if ai
mi = (u, v) and v ̸= ti we create the pair (v, ti)
• if ai
j = (u, v), ai
j+1 = (v′, w) and v ̸= v′ we create the pair (v, v′).
We repeat this process for all pairs in T . Let T ′ be the new set of terminals. Notice that, in order
to create si-ti paths that respect the given path forms we need to connect all the terminal pairs in T ′
with undirected paths.
We can compute the minimum cost paths between all pairs in T ′ by solving the instance (G−A, T ′).
This can be done in polynomial time as any pair of vertices has a unique path in G −A since G −A
is a forest.
Using the solution of (G −A, T ′) with the path forms we have guessed we have the solution that
agrees with the path forms and has minimum possible crossing cost.
⋄
Note that, each of our guesses defines an instance of Pre-Described CC-MAR problem. Since we
can compute a solution of each such an instance polynomial time, we can compute an optimal solution
for CC-MARby solving all instances and keeping the solution of minimum cost.
The only part of our algorithm that is not polynomial is the guesses of the path forms. Therefore,
the algorithm terminates in 2k|A|(|A|!)k|V |O(1) = |A|O(k|A|)|V |O(1).
4.4
Parameterized by number of arcs plus diameter
Theorem 10. A minimum-cost solution for a CC-MAR instance (G, T ) can be computed in FPT
time when parametrized by |A| + diam(G), where diam(G) is the diameter of G.
Proof. We first prove that a mixed graph bounded A + diam(G) has a bounded number of vertices.
Recall that by Observation 1 we can assume that the given graph is acyclic and has no vertex of degree
1.
Note that G −A is a forest with at most 2|A| leaves. Also, ∆(G −A) ≤2|A| as any tree has
maximum degree at most equal to the number of leaves. Therefore, the maximum degree in G is at
most 3|A|. Finally, any graph of diameter diam(G) and maximum degree ∆has 1+diam(G)∆diam(G)
vertices [12].
Finally, since the number of vertices in G are bounded by a function of |A| + diam(G), using
Proposition 1 results to an algorithm that runs in FPT time, parameterized by |A| + diam(G). This
completes the proof.

Minimum-Cost Solution on Restricted Settings
5.1
Parameterization by vertex cover number in unweighted graphs
In this section, we consider unweighted graphs. We first show that the problem becomes tractable
when parameterized by the vertex cover number plus k. Then, we show that the vertex cover number
alone suffices if we additionally assume that terminal pairs do not overlap.
Theorem 11. CC-MAR on unweighted graphs is FPT when parameterized by the vertex cover number
vc plus the number of agents k.
13


--- Page 14 ---
Proof. The main idea is to construct a small equivalent instance whose size is exponential in the
parameter vc+k. We begin by computing a vertex cover S of size at most 2vc (achievable in polynomial
time [4]). We then augment S to include all terminal vertices, so its new size is bounded by |S| ≤
2vc + 2k.
By the definition of a vertex cover, I = V \ S is an independent set. This means any path that
enters a vertex in I from a vertex in S must immediately return to a vertex in S.
We can categorize vertices in I by their ”type,” which is defined by their neighborhood in S.
Specifically, two vertices v1, v2 ∈I are of the same type if they are connected to the exact same subset
of vertices in S via undirected edges, incoming arcs, and outgoing arcs. For any vertex v ∈I, its
neighborhood is defined by three subsets of S. Therefore, the total number of distinct types is at most
2|S| · 2|S| · 2|S| = 8|S|.
Now, consider a set of vertices in I that are all of the same type. Since there are only k agents,
at most k of these functionally identical vertices can be used in any given solution. Any additional
vertices of this type are redundant. Therefore, we can safely reduce the number of vertices of each
type to just k.
This reduction rule creates a small instance with at most (2vc + 2k) + 8|S| · k vertices. By Propo-
sition 1, the problem is FPT when parameterized by vc + k.
Theorem 12. Let (G, T ) be an instance of CC-MAR where G is an unweighted graph and no vertex
of V (G) appears in more than one terminal pair. A minimum-cost solution of (G, T ) can be computed
in FPT time when parameterized by the vertex cover number vc of G.
Proof. Recall that we can assume that G is acyclic due to Observation 1. Let G be a graph with
vertex cover number vc. Let S ⊆V be a vertex cover of G of size vc. It can be computed in time
2vcnO(1) [21]. Also, let I = V \ S be the corresponding independent set.
We now define types of terminal pairs. In particular:
• Any pair (s, t) ∈T such that s, t ∩S ̸= ∅has a unique type.
• Two terminal pairs (s, t), (s′, t′) ∈T , where s, t, s′, t′ ∈I, have the same type if:
– N +(s) = N +(s′), N −(s) = N −(s′), and N(s) = N(s′), and
– N +(t) = N +(t′), N −(t) = N −(t′), and N(t) = N(t′).
Note that this gives us at most vc unique types, and at most 16vc additional types.
Indeed, the
additional types are at most 16vc, as the number of different neighborhoods for vertices in I is 4vc.
Using the types of pairs, we define types of vertices as follows:
• For each type of terminal pair, we define two vertex types: one for the source vertices of this
type and one for the sink vertices. This gives us at most 16vc+1 + 2vc types.
• Two non-terminal vertices u, v ∈I have the same type if N +(u) = N +(v), N −(u) = N −(v), and
N(u) = N(v). This gives us at most 4vc additional types.
• Finally, we assign a unique type to each non-terminal vertex in S, giving at most vc additional
types.
Note that each vertex type includes either non-terminal vertices with the same neighborhood or
terminal vertices that are all either sources or sinks of a given terminal pair type. Also, each vertex in
S has its own unique type.
Finally, if a vertex type contains more than one vertex, then all vertices of that type are incident
to only one edge. Indeed, otherwise we could create a cycle, which contradicts the assumption that G
is acyclic.
We proceed by defining types of paths in G using the previously defined types of vertices. To do
so, we first note that any path has length at most 2vc + 1, and no two consecutive vertices belong to
I. This holds because the vertices in I form an independent set.
This gives us at most (2vcvc!)(16vc+1 + 4vc + 1)vc+1 types of paths, where the first factor accounts
for the vertices from S that appear in the path and their ordering, while the second factor accounts
for whether a vertex from I appears between vertices of S, and if so, what type it has.
14


--- Page 15 ---
Having defined types of terminals, vertices, and paths, we are now ready to prove that there exists
an optimal solution satisfying some very restricted properties.
Before stating the claim, we define what we refer to as the intermediate vertices of a path. Given
a u–v path P, we define the intermediate vertices of P as the set V (P) \ u, v.
Claim 3. There exist an optimal solution P of (G, T ) where, from any given type of vertices in I at
most two vertices of this type appear as intermediate vertices in the paths in P.
Proof of the claim. We start with an optimal solution P. Let ν be a type of vertices in I such that at
least three vertices of type ν appear in P as intermediate vertices. We will show how to modify the
paths so that only two vertices of type ν appear as intermediate vertices, without changing any of the
vertices of any other type.
Note that each vertex of type ν is incident to at most one edge. Indeed, otherwise we could create
a cycle, which contradicts the assumption that G is acyclic.
We consider two cases: either each vertex of type ν has zero edges incident to it, or each has exactly
one edge incident to it.
Case 1 (each vertex is incident to zero edges): Fix a vertex u of the given type. Consider any
appearance of a vertex of type ν as an intermediate vertex; let v be such a vertex. It is safe to replace
v with u. Indeed, since u and v have the same type, they have the same neighborhood. Also, the cost
does not change, since we only replace arcs in the paths. We can repeat this until only v appears as
an intermediate vertex of type ν.
Case 2 (each vertex is incident to one edge): Let w be the common neighbor of all vertices of type
ν, such that v, w ∈E for all vertices v of type ν.
We define two sets of vertices, V +
ν and V −
ν . We set V +
ν to be the set of vertices of type ν such that:
• v appears as an intermediate vertex in a path P ∈P, and
• v appears exactly before w in P.
We define V −
ν
to be the set of vertices of type ν such that:
• v appears as an intermediate vertex in a path P ∈P, and
• v appears exactly after w in P.
We first modify the paths so that V +
ν
contains at most one vertex. If |V +
ν | ≤1, we do not need to
do anything. Therefore, assume that |V +
ν | ≥2, and select arbitrarily a vertex v ∈V +
ν . For each path
in P, we proceed with the following modification:
• For each P ∈P,
• Find any vertex of type ν that appears before w in P,
• Replace this vertex with v.
Let P′ be the set of paths after these modifications. Note that, since vertices of the same type have
the same neighborhood, P′ is a feasible solution for (G, T ). We now show that it is also an optimal
solution.
We show that starting from an optimal solution, replacing just one vertex results in another optimal
solution. Let u be the vertex we replaced with v in a path P ∈P. Also, let P ′ be a path in which v
appears before w in P (such a path exists since v ∈V +
ν ). The only change in the set of edges appearing
in P is that we replaced u, w with v, w.
Let x1 be the number of appearances of the edge w, u (oriented as (w, u)) in the paths of P, and
let x2 be the number of appearances of the edge w, v (oriented as (w, v)). Note that x1 = x2. Indeed,
otherwise, replacing u with v in P, or replacing v with u in P ′, would result in a feasible solution with
lower cost.
Therefore, replacing u with v in P results in a new optimal solution. This means that the previous
process creates a sequence of optimal solutions until V +
ν = v.
Using symmetric arguments, we can reduce V −
ν
to a singleton.
This shows that the only vertices of type ν appearing as intermediate vertices are those in the sets
V +
ν
and V −
ν .
15


--- Page 16 ---
Since the previous process affects only vertices of the same type, we can repeat it for all types that
appear more than twice as intermediate vertices. Thus, the claim holds.
⋄
Hereafter, we assume that we have an optimal solution that satisfies the properties of Claim 3. Since
each terminal pair is related to exactly 2 types of vertices, for each type of terminals, at most 4 pairs of
each type have their vertices as intermediate vertices in the considered optimal solution. Now, we will
show that we can predetermine which terminal pairs are allowed to be used as intermediate vertices
in paths. Before that, we will define the sets of vertices that we would like to allow as intermediate
vertices.
For each type of terminals τ, let Tτ ⊆T be the set of all terminal pairs of type τ. We select
(arbitrarily) min 4, |Tτ| pairs of terminals of type τ; let T ∗
τ be the set of these terminals.
Claim 4. There exists an optimal solution P where any terminal vertex v that appears as an inter-
mediate vertex in a path in P belongs to a set T ∗
τ .
Proof of the claim. Note that we need to prove the claim for types τ such that |Tτ| > 4. Consider a
type τ and a pair (s, t) ∈Tτ \T ∗
τ such that either s or t appear as intermediate vertices in a path in P.
We will show how to modify P in order to replace all appearances of s and t as intermediate vertices
with appearances of s′ and t′ where (s′, t′) ∈T ∗
τ . Also, this process will not affect any other vertices.
Note that, since in P at most 4 pairs of type τ are used as intermediate vertices and (s, t) ∈Tτ \T ∗
τ
there exists at least one pair (s′, t′) ∈T ∗
τ where neither s′ nor t′ appear as intermediate vertices in any
path in P.
Since (s, t) and (s′, t′) are of the same type of terminals, by replacing all appearances of s with s′
and t with t′ we obtain a feasible solution of the same exact crossing cost. To see this, observe that
any additional cost may appear because of edges incident to s, t, s′, and t′. However since we have
replace all appearances, then any cost related to some edge {v, w}, for v ∈{s, t} and a w ∈V was
already appearing in P because of the edge {v′, w}, for some v′ ∈{s′, t′}. Similarly, any cost related
to some edge {v′, w}, for v′ ∈{s′, t′} and a w ∈V was already appearing in P because of the edge
{v, w}, for some v ∈{s, t}.
Finally, we repeat this until the only intermediate vertices that belong in terminals of type τ are
these in T ∗
τ . Also, this does not affect any other terminal types. Therefore, we can repeat this for all
terminal types.
⋄
Now, we prove a similar claim about the appearances of vertices from I that are not terminal
vertices. Let, for each type ν of vertices that does not include a terminal vertex, Vν be the set of all
vertices of type ν. For each such type, we select (arbitrarily) min 2, |Vν| vertices of type ν; let V ∗
ν be
the set of selected vertices.
Claim 5. There exists an optimal solution P where any non-terminal vertex v that appears in a path
in P belongs in a set V ∗
ν .
Proof of the claim. The proof follows the same arguments as the proof of Claim 4
We need to prove the claim for types ν such that |Vν| > 2.
Consider a type ν and a vertex
v ∈Vν \ V ∗
ν that appears in a path in P. Since we consider non-terminal vertices, we know that these
vertices appear only as intermediate vertices in P. We will show how to modify P in order to replace
all appearances of v with appearances of v′, where v′ ∈V ∗
ν . Also, this process will not affect any other
vertices.
By the claim 3, since in P at most 2 vertices of type ν are used as intermediate vertices and
v ∈Vν \ V ∗
ν , there exists at least one vertex v′ ∈V ∗
ν that does not appear as an intermediate vertex in
any path in P.
Since v and v′ are of the same type of vertices, by replacing all appearances of v with v′, we obtain
a feasible solution of the exact same crossing cost. To see this, observe that any additional cost is
due to edges incident to v and v′. However, since we have replaced all appearances, any cost related
to some edge v, w, for some w ∈V , was already present in P due to the edge v′, w. Similarly, any
cost related to some edge v′, w, for some w ∈V , was already present in P because of the edge v, w.
Therefore, the case is the same, and the new solution is also optimal.
We repeat this until the only intermediate vertices of type ν are those in V ∗
ν . Also, this does not
affect any other types. Therefore, we can repeat this for all types.
⋄
16


--- Page 17 ---
The Claims 4 and 5 allow us to avoid guessing which vertices of each type are used as intermediate
vertices in an optimal solution, as we can select (arbitrarily) the vertices of each type that will be used
as intermediate vertices.
The final step before we proceed with the algorithm is to show that, for each type, the terminal
pairs that do not appear as intermediate vertices can use the same type of paths.
Claim 6. There exists an optimal solution P such that, for each type of terminals τ and pair
(s, t), (s′, t′) ∈Tτ \ T ∗
τ the s-t path and s′-t′ path in P have the same path type.
Proof of the claim. Consider an optimal solution that satisfies the claims 5 and 4. Consider a type
of terminals τ and (s, t), (s′, t′) ∈Tτ \ T ∗
τ such that the s-t path P and the s′-t′ path P ′ in P do not
have the same path type. We will prove that we can modify only one of P, P ′ so that they both have
the same type. Let Q and Q′ be the paths we obtain from P and P ′, respectively, by swapping the
vertices s and s′, and t and t′. Note that Q is an s′-t′ path that has the same type as P, and Q′ is an
s-t path that has the same type as P ′.
We claim that both (P \ P) ∪Q′ and (P \ P ′) ∪Q are optimal solutions. To see this, let e1, . . . , ep
be the edges appearing in P that also appear, in the opposite direction, in other paths of P. Also,
let xi, i ∈[p], be the number of times the edge ei appears in a path of P in the opposite direction to
the one it appears in P. Similarly, let e′
1, . . . , e′
q be the edges appearing in P ′ that also appear, in the
opposite direction, in other paths of P, and let x′
j, j ∈[q], be the number of times the edge e′
j appears
in a path of P in the opposite direction to the one it appears in P ′.
Note that none of the edges ei, i ∈[p], or e′
j, j ∈[q], are incident to s, s′, t, or t′. This is because
none of these vertices are used as intermediate vertices in any path, and since we have no overlapping
terminals, they appear only in their own paths.
By construction of Q and Q′, the following two inequalities hold:
cost(P) ≤cost((P \ {P}) ∪{Q′}) ≤cost(P) −
X
i∈[p]
xi +
X
j∈[q]
x′
j,
cost(P) ≤cost((P \ {P ′}) ∪{Q}) ≤cost(P) −
X
j∈q
x′
j +
X
i∈[p]
xi.
Therefore, we can conclude that P
j∈[q] x′
j = P
i∈[p] xi and all three solutions are optimal. By selecting
one of the pairs (s, t) ∈Tτ \ T ∗
τ , we can repeat the previous process until all other pairs use paths of
the same path type as (s, t). This does not affect the path types used by terminals of other terminal
types, so we can apply it independently for each terminal type. Thus, the claim holds.
⋄
Now, we are ready to provide the algorithm. First, we fix the sets V ∗
ν and T ∗
τ , for all types of
non-terminal vertices and terminal pairs, respectively. We consider a terminal type τ. Due to Claim 6
we know that there exists a solution where at most 5 different types of paths connect terminal pairs of
type τ: one for each pair in T ∗τ and one for the rest. Note that, we can guess the types that connect
all pairs in FPT time, as the number of types of paths is bounded by a function of vc.
After guessing the paths, we need to decide which are the intermediate vertices. Any path has
at most vc + 1 vertices from I, and we know the type of all such vertices. Therefore, for each guess,
we have at most 5vc + 5 intermediate vertices that are unknown. For the non-terminal intermediate
vertices, we have at most 2 possible options. Therefore, we can guess them, needing at most 25vc+5
guesses. For the terminal vertices, after we check the type, we need to check which terminal type
includes this type of vertex. Since we have at most 4 terminal pairs for each type and the types of
vertices depend on whether the vertex is a source or sink, we only have 4 possible guesses. Therefore,
at most 45vc+5 guesses. After these guesses, we have fixed all the paths that connect any pair of type
τ.
Since we have 16vc many different types of terminals, we can guess these paths for all different
types. After the guesses, we have created FPT many feasible solutions. Also, since we have made
all possible guesses, we have created at least one optimal solution. Since we can compute the cost of
a feasible solution in polynomial time, it suffices to compute the cost of all the feasible solutions we
created and keep the smallest.

5.2
Overwhelming number of agents
In this section, we show that, if almost all pairs of vertices appear as terminal pairs, then we can decide
if there exists a 0-cost solution.
Theorem 13. We can decide whether a CC-MAR instance (G, T ) admits a 0-cost solution in FPT
time parameterized by |N|, where N = (V × V ) \ T .
Proof. Consider an edge e = {u, v} ∈E. We claim that either the cost of any solution is at least 1, or
at least one of (u, v), (v, u) belongs to N.
Assume that neither (u, v) nor (v, u) belongs to N. Then both (u, v), (v, u) ∈T . Since we can
assume that G is acyclic, there exists neither a u-v path excluding {u, v} nor a v-u path excluding
{u, v}. Therefore, both paths must use {u, v}, and no solution of cost 0 exists. Note that this condition
can be verified in polynomial time.
Hereafter, we assume that for any e = {u, v} ∈E, at least one of (u, v) or (v, u) belongs to N,
thus |N| ≥|E|. By Theorem 8, we can compute the optimal solution in FPT time parameterized by
|E| ≤|N|.

Conclusion
We introduced the Crossing Cost Multi-Agent Routing (CC-MAR) model, a reasonable framework
for asynchronous multi-agent routing where head-on interactions are captured via a soft cost function
rather than hard constraints. This setting reflects real-world scenarios where agents operate without
global synchronization and where congestion arises from opposing edge traversals. Our analysis com-
bines game-theoretic and algorithmic perspectives. We showed that Nash equilibrial always exist and
are reachable via convergent dynamics, with polynomial-time computability under mild assumptions,
and PLS-completeness in the general case. On the optimization side, we first observe that our problem
generalizes the Steiner Orientation problem and thus is NP-hard. To overcome this, we developed
parameterized algorithms with FPT and XP guarantees for various structural parameters, such as the
number of arcs, edges, and terminal pairs, as well as vertex cover number.
This framework opens several directions for future research. In particular, while we provide FPT
algorithms for parameters involving the number of arcs and edges, the parameterized complexity with
respect to |A| alone remains unresolved. Further exploration of efficient heuristics or approximation
schemes for practical instances remains an open and practically relevant challenge.
