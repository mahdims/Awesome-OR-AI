ABSTRACT
Geospatial modeling provides critical solutions for pressing global challenges
such as sustainability and climate change.
Existing large language model
(LLM)–based algorithm discovery frameworks, such as AlphaEvolve, excel at
evolving generic code but lack the domain knowledge and multi-step reasoning
required for complex geospatial problems. We introduce GeoEvolve, a multi-
agent LLM framework that couples evolutionary search with geospatial domain
knowledge to automatically design and refine geospatial algorithms. GeoEvolve
operates in two nested loops: an inner loop leverages a code evolver to generate
and mutate candidate solutions, while an outer agentic controller evaluates global
elites and queries a GeoKnowRAG module—a structured geospatial knowledge
base that injects theoretical priors from geography. This knowledge-guided evo-
lution steers the search toward theoretically meaningful and computationally effi-
cient algorithms. We evaluate GeoEvolve on two fundamental and classical tasks:
spatial interpolation (kriging) and spatial uncertainty quantification (geospatial
conformal prediction). Across these benchmarks, GeoEvolve automatically im-
proves and discovers new algorithms, incorporating geospatial theory on top of
classical models. It reduces spatial interpolation error (RMSE) by 13–21% and
enhances uncertainty estimation performance by 17 %. Ablation studies confirm
that domain-guided retrieval is essential for stable, high-quality evolution. These
results demonstrate that GeoEvolve provides a scalable path toward automated,
knowledge-driven geospatial modeling, opening new opportunities for trustwor-
thy and efficient AI-for-Science discovery.

INTRODUCTION
Beyond building powerful AI models that help us analyze data and understand the world, enabling
AI models to evolve on their own and autonomously extract knowledge stands as the next important
and promising frontier. It usually involves a prolonged procedure of asking a research question,
gathering relevant information, analyzing it to identify patterns or insights, and communicating the
results as new knowledge. The rise of the large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 (Achiam
et al., 2023) and Gemini (Comanici et al., 2025), presents the possibility of accelerating and au-
tomating this knowledge discovery procedure. The confidence in this direction is supported by the
breakthroughs in LLMs, such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) that enhances the output of
LLMs (Lewis et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2023) and agents that execute complex tasks autonomously
(Li et al., 2023; Qian et al., 2024). In fact, the integration of LLMs into this procedure has al-
ready boosted the performance of a range of discovery-oriented tasks, such as drug repurposing

(Huang et al., 2024), hypothesis generation (Kumbhar et al., 2025; Xiong et al., 2024), chip design
(Ho & Ren, 2024), urban planning (Zhou et al., 2024). Recently, Google introduced AlphaEvolve,
which has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in automating algorithm discovery across diverse
domains, such as tackling complex mathematical optimization problems. Building on this foun-
dation, OpenEvolve has been developed as an open-source implementation of Google DeepMind’s
AlphaEvolve, providing the research community with accessible tools for further exploration and
application.
Despite these advances, the domain of geospatial modeling remains relatively underexplored in
the context of LLM-driven knowledge discovery. Geospatial problems are inherently complicated,
characterized by spatial autocorrelation (Miller, 2004), spatial heterogeneity (Cheng et al., 2024),
scale effect (Chen et al., 2019), and diverse modalities (e.g., maps, remote sensing imagery, spatial
network, and textual description) (Mai et al., 2023), etc. Moreover, addressing geospatial problems
also demands synthesizing knowledge across different disciplines, from environmental science to
urban studies, making it difficult for single-agent systems to provide comprehensive solutions.
In this paper, we introduce GeoEvolve, an advanced agent combining the evolutionary process with
LLM-based code generation and geospatial knowledge-informed RAG (GeoKnowRAG) to automat-
ically investigate optimal geospatial modeling. GeoEvolve operates in two complementary loops.
As is shown in Figure 1, the inner loop runs OpenEvolve (Sharma, 2025) for a limited number of
evolutionary steps, generating cadidates of discovery. The outer loop is governed by an agentic con-
troller, which evaluates the best solutions, retains global elites to prevent performance degradation,
and invokes the GeoKnowRAG module. This module will query a structured geospatial knowledge
database, thus producing refined, domain-informed prompts that guide the next round evolution. We
show that GeoEvolve can obviously improve the geospatial modeling.
In summary, the contributions of our work are as follows:
1. Knowledge-guided evolution. We integrate evolutionary search with domain knowledge
by coupling GeoEvolve’s evolutionary code generation (via OpenEvolve) with retrieval-
augmented geospatial knowledge. This grounds discovery in established geospatial theo-
ries and classical methods rather than random mutations, steering evolution toward theo-
retically meaningful and practically effective directions.
2. Automated, scalable pipeline. We develop an automated and scalable geospatial modeling
pipeline that can continuously evolve, adapt, and refine geospatial algorithms, providing a
robust methodology for diverse geospatial tasks.
3. State-of-the-art performance and efficiency.
We demonstrate state-of-the-art perfor-
mance on two spatial modeling cases—spatial interpolation and spatial uncertainty quan-
tification—supported by an ablation study verifying the role of domain knowledge.

RELATED WORK
LLM-driven Algorithm Discovery
Driven by LLMs, many studies aim to accelerate the dis-
covery of algorithms with better performance, simpler implementation, and higher computational
efficiency. A common approach is evolutionary search, which explores the algorithmic space via
mutations and recombinations guided by performance metrics (Surina et al., 2025), enabling break-
throughs across diverse applications (Lu et al., 2024; Ma et al., 2024; Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2024; Mor-
ris et al., 2024). Among the most influential methods is FunSearch—searching in the function
space—which fosters creative algorithmic solutions while guarding against confabulations (Romera-
Paredes et al., 2024), but is limited to evolving a single function rather than an entire codebase.
AlphaEvolve, a substantially enhanced successor, leverages LLMs to solve complex problems at
scale (Novikov et al., 2025). Yet addressing specialized challenges, particularly in geospatial do-
mains, requires domain-specific knowledge, multi-step reasoning, and iterative refinement guided
by evaluation feedback (Chen et al., 2024).
Retrieval-augmented generation RAG for scientific discovery.
RAG has emerged as a standard
strategy to ground LLM outputs in external knowledge, improving factual accuracy and controllabil-
ity (Lewis et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2023). Recent advances such as RAG-Fusion (Rackauckas, 2024)

and reciprocal rank fusion (RRF) (Cormack et al., 2009) demonstrate that expanding and fusing mul-
tiple reformulated queries can substantially enhance retrieval coverage and downstream reasoning
quality. Moreover, RAG has recently been applied in the geospatial domain to support knowledge
discovery and contribute to downstream tasks such as spatial reasoning (Yu et al., 2025). However,
to the best of our knowledge, no prior work has leveraged RAG to extract geospatial knowledge
specifically for geospatial model construction, leaving an important gap for integrating structured
geographic knowledge into model design.

GEOEVOLVE
GeoEvolve is designed to automate geospatial model discovery by integrating evolutionary code
generation with structured geospatial knowledge. Unlike general-purpose code agents, GeoEvolve
incorporates domain-specific knowledge from spatial modeling literature and classical algorithms,
enabling the discovery of geospatial algorithms. Figure 2 illustrates the overall framework of Geo-
Evolve. It consists of four main components: (1) a code evolver, (2) an evolved code analyzer, (3)
a geospatial knowledge retriever, and (4) a geo-informed prompt generator. Together, these compo-
nents orchestrate a closed-loop process of code generation, evaluation, and refinement, leading to
the emergence of geospatial model discovery.
3.1
CODE EVOLVER
The central engine of GeoEvolve is the code evolver, an evolutionary coding agent that generates and
iteratively refines candidate algorithms. Beginning with an initial algorithm, the evolver performs
a fully autonomous pipeline of mutation, evaluation, and selection relying on the power of LLMs.
Candidate algorithms are represented as a group of executable code fragments. Mutations can be
parameter changes, operator substitutions, or structure modifications to the algorithm. Abstractly,
given a task-specific objective function L, the evolver seeks to optimize an algorithm A such that
A∗= arg min
A∈A L(A; D),
(1)
where A is the search space and D is the dataset. Here, we use OpenEvolve as the code evolver,
which is the open-source equivalent of AlphaEvolve.

3.2
EVOLVED CODE ANALYZER
The evolved code analyzer is an LLM-powered diagnostic agent that interprets both the evolved code
and associated metrics (e.g., RMSE for regression tasks). Its role is not limited to evaluating task
outcomes, but also to providing semantic analysis of the code, thus identifying potential weaknesses
or missing knowledge. To be specific, the LLM is required to achieve two tasks. First, it identifies
missing or problematic knowledge from the evolved code. Second, it suggests search queries for
retrieving useful geospatial knowledge from GeoKnowRAG. The diagnostic feedback given by this
agent will be passed to the geospatial knowledge retriever to obtain related knowledge. This design
allows GeoEvolve to reason about why the evolved algorithm fails and what kind of domain knowl-
edge is needed to improve it. The template and an example of the code analyzer can be found at
Figure 6.
3.3
GEOSPATIAL KNOWLEDGE RETRIEVER
To prevent the evolutionary search from drifting into non-meaningful algorithmic space, GeoEvolve
incorporates domain-specific geospatial knowledge through a dedicated Geospatial Knowledge Re-
trieval module (GeoKnowRAG). We construct a structured knowledge base by collecting literature
on core geospatial modeling concepts (e.g., spatial autocorrelation) and classical algorithms (e.g.,
geographically weighted regression) from Wikipedia, arXiv, and GitHub, using curated keywords
(Figure 7, Appendix A.3.1). To ensure high-quality and comprehensive knowledge coverage, RAG-
Fusion (Rackauckas, 2024) is applied to merge results from multiple reformulated queries, enabling
the system to capture both precise theoretical matches and semantically related concepts. Geo-
KnowRAG transforms these diverse resources into a structured RAG system that delivers domain-
aware prompts directly to the code evolver, providing the theoretical grounding and classical geospa-
tial methods required for effective algorithmic refinement. As shown in Figure 3, GeoKnowRAG
comprises four steps:
Source Identification and Acquisition
First, we curate three complementary knowledge corpora:
peer-reviewed geospatial modeling and algorithm papers in PDF form, authoritative encyclopedic
entries from Wikipedia, and open-source code repositories from GitHub. Second, we compile a
topic list that covers key spatial modeling concepts such as spatial autocorrelation, heterogeneity,
kriging, geographically weighted regression, spatial conformal prediction, and network topology.
Third, using these topics as queries, automated scripts call the Wikipedia, arXiv, and GitHub APIs to
download relevant text and code, which are then converted into normalized UTF-8 .txt documents.
Text Chunking and Pre-processing
First, each document is semantically segmented into 300-
word chunks with a 50-word overlap to preserve contextual continuity across chunk boundaries

and improve downstream retrieval accuracy. Second, all PDF, Markdown, and HTML sources are
stripped of formatting, de-duplicated, and tokenized into a clean corpus ready for embedding.
Vectorization
and
Knowledge
Indexing
First,
every
chunk
is
encoded
using
the
text-embedding-3-small model from OpenAI to obtain high-dimensional semantic
vectors.
Second, these embeddings are stored in a Chroma vector database, which supports
approximate nearest-neighbor search and metadata filtering by topic or source type. Third, this
indexed database forms the persistent memory of GeoKnowRAG and enables millisecond-scale
retrieval across the geospatial knowledge space.
RAG-Fusion Query and Prompt Generation
First, GeoKnowRAG employs multi-angle ques-
tion expansion, where each input query from the GeoEvolve controller is reformulated into several
sub-questions emphasizing different semantic aspects such as theory, implementation, and evalua-
tion. Second, each sub-question is independently embedded and used for vector search to retrieve
top-k relevant chunks from the Chroma index. Third, the retrieved results are re-ranked using RRF,
which scores passages based on the reciprocal of their ranks across sub-queries so that consistently
high-scoring chunks surface to the top. Fourth, the highest-ranked passages are aggregated and
summarized into a geo-informed prompt encoding key formulas, algorithmic structures, and empir-
ical heuristics, which is then supplied to the GeoEvolve code evolver to guide the next round of
algorithmic mutation and evaluation.
3.4
GEO-INFORMED PROMPT GENERATOR
The information, from retrieved geospatial knowledge to evolved code, and associated metrics, is
then processed together by the geo-informed prompt generator, which will translate it into a struc-
tured prompt for the code evolver. This prompt refines the search by introducing domain constraints,
suggesting algorithmic structures, or incorporating empirical heuristics. The generator leverages
LLMs as reasoning and translation engines, transforming abstract geospatial knowledge into action-
able modifications of candidate code.
The LLMs are required to generate a prompt that includes four key elements. First, algorithmic fixes
or improvements suggesting how the current algorithm could be revised. Second, new operators or
parameters that may improve performance in subsequent evolutionary iterations. Third, geospatial
knowledge, including the direction of exploration, theoretical or empirical conditions, and expected
outputs. Fourth, maximum tokens control, which helps maintain efficiency and reduce hallucination.

EXPERIMENTS
To evaluate GeoEvolve’s capability for improving and discovering geospatial models, we focus on
two fundamental topics in geospatial modeling: spatial interpolation and uncertainty quantification
of spatial prediction. For each topic, we select the most representative and classical baseline model,
and employ a GPT-4–based evolutionary engine as the core evolve agent to autonomously search,
mutate, and refine candidate algorithms.
We use OpenEvolve as the primary baseline. In addition, we conduct an ablation study with two
variants. First, OpenEvolve with GeoKnowledge Prompt, where domain knowledge is incorporated
as additional prompts. The prompt template is: “You are allowed to refer to advanced methods in
the field of spatial interpolation and consider some important settings of spatial models, such as
localized variogram, automatic variogram parameter selection, or stratified strategy, etc.” Second,
GeoEvolve without GeoKnowledge, where the GeoKnowRAG module is removed. For every algo-
rithm, after each evolutionary step the generated code is first analyzed by the code analyzer and then
directly passed to the knowledge-prompt generator to create new prompts.
For the OpenEvolve-based algorithms, we perform ten iterations of evolutionary search. For the
GeoEvolve algorithms, we run ten outer-loop cycles—each consisting of the code analyzer, Geo-
KnowRAG, and geo-informed prompt generator—and within every outer cycle we conduct ten
inner-loop evolutions. This results in a total of one hundred evolutionary iterations. For every
experiment, the dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets in an 8:1:1 ratio.
4.1
SPATIAL INTERPOLATION MODEL
Task- Spatial interpolation
Spatial interpolation is one of the most important applications in
geospatial analysis and a key approach for humans to observe the Earth’s surface environment and
understand the planet (Lam, 1983). Its task is to model discrete sample points collected across
geographic space—such as climate observation stations, biodiversity observation points, or mineral
sampling sites—and to predict the continuous spatial surface of the geographic variables of interest
based on these observations.
Model- Oridinary Kriging
We selected ordinary kriging, the most classical geostatistical spatial
interpolation model, as the first case study for GeoEvolve to automatically improve and evaluate.
Since its invention, many studies have attempted to extend kriging, for example by integrating re-
gression models in regression kriging (Hengl et al., 2007) or by accounting for spatially stratified
heterogeneity in stratified kriging (Luo et al., 2023). However, ordinary kriging remains the funda-
mental core of the entire kriging family and of geostatistics itself. Because it was developed long
ago and has a relatively simple structure, direct algorithmic innovations to ordinary kriging have
become increasingly rare. More details about ordinary kriging can be found at Appendix A.3.1.
If GeoEvolve can demonstrably enhance ordinary kriging, it would greatly revitalize geostatistical
methods and provide fundamental improvements that can propagate to all kriging-based models and
applications.This rationale underpins our choice of ordinary kriging as the first benchmark algorithm
in this study.
Evaluator
For the kriging interpolation task, we use the root mean squared error (RMSE) as the
evaluation metric. Our objective is to obtain a kriging model that achieves a lower RMSE, indicating
higher predictive accuracy.
Datasets
In this study, we use trace-element observations of copper (Cu), lead (Pb), and zinc
(Zn) collected from a representative region of Australia (with concentrations expressed in parts per
million, ppm) to conduct spatial interpolation and geostatistical modeling experiments. These three
heavy metals have important indicative significance in environmental geochemistry: on the one
hand, they serve as key factors for assessing regional environmental pollution levels and soil heavy-
metal accumulation. Details of the data acquisition and processing procedures can be found in (Luo
et al., 2025).

4.1.1
EVOLVED ALGORITHM OF ORDINARY KRIGING.
GeoEvolve preserves the ordinary-kriging core but augments it with (i) an expanded variogram
family (Exponential, Gaussian, Linear, and Mat´ern) with automatic model selection via AIC/BIC,
capturing a wider range of spatial smoothness; (ii) an adaptive empirical variogram using quan-
tile/Silverman binning, trimmed means, and an automatic nlags ∈[8, 20] ∝√n to stabilize
nugget/sill/range estimation; (iii) robust multi-start fitting with L1 or weighted least squares and
bin-based weights to avoid local minima and keep parameters physically meaningful; (iv) localized
kriging that solves a K-NN system with condition-number–aware diagonal adjustment, reducing
complexity from O(n3) to O(K3) and improving numerical stability; and (v) an adaptive log trans-
form with a data-driven offset to reduce skew and ensure valid back-transformation. Together, these
changes retain unbiasedness and best-linear prediction while delivering lower RMSE/MAE, tighter
residuals, and greater computational robustness across heterogeneous spatial settings. The detailed
development of GeoEvolve–Kriging can be found at Appendix A.4.1.
4.1.2
MODEL EVALUATION
Table 1 reports the kriging accuracy obtained by different methods. GeoEvolve–kriging consistently
achieves the lowest RMSE and MAE across the prediction of Cu, Pb, and Zn, while the original krig-
ing baseline performs worst. Applying OpenEvolve to kriging improves the prediction of Cu and Pb
but slightly degrades the performance on Zn. Introducing GeoKnowledge prompts into OpenEvolve
does not lead to further gains, possibly because the injected knowledge lacks direct relevance to
variogram estimation or spatial covariance structures that govern kriging performance. GeoEvolve
without GeoKnowRAG already outperforms OpenEvolve, yet still falls short of the full GeoEvolve
model, underscoring the critical role of structured geospatial domain knowledge in guiding algo-
rithm evolution.
Compared with OpenEvolve–kriging, GeoEvolve–kriging reduces RMSE by 11.3%, 20.9%, and
13.5% on Cu, Pb, and Zn predictions, respectively. Relative to the original kriging, the reductions
are 15.4%, 21.2%, and 13.0%, further highlighting GeoEvolve’s ability to automatically discover
and refine spatial interpolation algorithms with substantially improved predictive accuracy.
Figure 4 illustrates the spatial distributions of the predicted concentrations and the associated error
maps for Cu, Pb, and Zn obtained by GeoEvolve–kriging, clearly demonstrating its capability to
capture fine-scale spatial variability while maintaining low residual errors.
4.2
SPATIAL UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION MODEL
Task- Spatial UQ
In spatial predictive modeling, it is not sufficient merely to develop more ac-
curate models for point predictions; an equally critical task is to quantify and communicate the
uncertainty of predictions, as this directly shapes the reliability and legitimacy of geography-based
decisions such as flood evacuation planning and public facility site selection. Therefore, incorpo-
rating rigorous uncertainty quantification into spatial prediction is essential not only for improving
scientific credibility, but also for supporting transparent, fair, and ethically sound spatial planning
and policy making.

Model- GeoCP
In geography, the task of assessing the reliability of spatial prediction results
is commonly addressed through uncertainty quantification (UQ). In this study, we adopt geospatial
conformal prediction (GeoCP)—a model-agnostic algorithm for estimating the uncertainty of spatial
prediction models—as the target method for enhancement using GeoEvolve (Lou et al., 2025). More
details about GeoCP can be found at Appendix A.3.2.
Evaluator
For GeoCP uncertainty estimation, we use the interval score
ISi = max(Ui −Li, ϵ) + 2
α

(Li −yi)I(yi < Li) + (yi −Ui)I(yi > Ui)

,
(2)
where Li, Ui are prediction bounds, yi the observation, and α the significance level (e.g., 0.1 for
90% intervals). The first term measures interval width (with ϵ ≈10−6 to avoid zero width), and
the second penalizes coverage violations, scaled by 1/α. Smaller IS indicates tighter and better-
calibrated intervals.
Datasets
The housing price dataset used in this study originates from the GeoDa Lab repository1.
The original data include 21,613 residential transactions and 21 attributes from Seattle and King
County, Washington (May 2014–May 2015). For our analysis, we focus on the Greater Seattle urban
core and retain 11 key variables, with housing sale price (in $10,000s) as the dependent variable.
Eight non-spatial predictors capture structural and quality characteristics—bathrooms, living-space
and lot size, grade, condition, waterfront proximity, view quality, and property age—while two
spatial predictors are geographic coordinates expressed in UTM. Further details of the dataset are
documented in (Lou et al., 2025).
4.2.1
EVOLVED ALGORITHM OF GEOCP
GeoEvolve–GeoCP preserves the fundamental conformal prediction framework of GeoCP while in-
troducing two major methodological advances. First, it refines the geographic weighting scheme:
still employing a Gaussian kernel, but re-optimizing the bandwidth parameter through multi-start
global search with adaptive clipping to ensure numerical stability and faithfully capture local spatial
heterogeneity. Second, it enhances the weighted quantile computation by unifying earlier adaptive
strategies into a simplified yet robust stepwise estimator with improved vectorization and condition-

analysis of GeoEvolve-GeoCP can be found at Appendix A.4.2.
4.2.2
MODEL EVALUATION
To perform GeoCP, we first build a house-price prediction model using a base predictor with eight
explanatory variables and two spatial variables as inputs. The trained model is then assessed with
GeoCP to quantify predictive uncertainty, and the final output is the uncertainty of house-price pre-
dictions on the test set. In this study, we choose XGBoost as the base predictor, which achieves
an R2 of 0.871 and an RMSE of 7.362 (10,000 USD). The results are presented in Figure 5. The
predicted uncertainty exhibits a clear spatial pattern: it is highest around Lake Washington in down-
town Seattle, slightly lower in suburban areas, and lowest in the rural southern region. A scatter plot
of predicted uncertainty versus predicted price further reveals that uncertainty increases with house
price, peaking at approximately 125 (10,000 USD) and then leveling off with a slight decline.
We apply GeoCP in four configurations, original, OpenEvolve, OpenEvolve with GeoKnowledge
Prompt, and GeoEvolve without GeoKnowRAG–to quantify uncertainty on the same test set. Table
2 reports the GeoCP performance obtained by different methods. As shown, OpenEvolve reduces the
interval score from 55.37 to 52.37. Adding GeoKnowledge to OpenEvolve does not further improve
performance. In contrast, GeoEvolve achieves an interval score of 46.12, representing reductions of
16.7% and 11.9% compared with the original GeoCP and OpenEvolve–GeoCP, respectively.

CONCLUSION
We presented GeoEvolve, a multi-agent LLM framework that couples evolutionary code search with
geospatial domain knowledge via GeoKnowRAG to automate geospatial model discovery. Across
two fundamental tasks—spatial interpolation (ordinary kriging) and spatial uncertainty quantifica-
tion (GeoCP)—GeoEvolve consistently improved upon classical baselines and strong OpenEvolve
variants. Ablations confirm that structured, domain-guided retrieval is pivotal: removing Geo-
KnowRAG degrades performance despite identical evolutionary budgets, underscoring the value
of grounding algorithm evolution in geospatial theory. In the future, we plan to evaluate the per-

USE OF LLMS
We use LLMs to polish selected paragraphs and to automatically extract differences between algo-
rithms (e.g., Kriging and GeoCP) produced by different code-generation methods (e.g., OpenEvolve
and GeoEvolve), thereby facilitating the analysis of GeoEvolve’s specific improvements and their
underlying causes. All research ideas were independently conceived by the authors.

CODE ANALYZER
Figure 6 shows the template of the Code Analyzer and an example output.

GEOSPATIAL KNOWLEDGE DATABASE
In this study, we retrieved geospatial knowledge using five categories of keywords, including pub-
lications, GitHub code, and Wikipedia. As is shown in Figure 7, the five categories are geostatis-
tics, spatial theory, GIScience, spatial statistics, and spatial modeling. The keywords within each
category were proposed by the authors based on their domain expertise, reflecting concepts we
consider particularly important for geospatial modeling. In total, 141 knowledge documents were
constructed.
It should be noted that the construction of a geospatial knowledge base can include many more key-
words, enabling a much larger scale—potentially comprising thousands of documents or developed
through more sophisticated processes. In the present experiments, however, we intentionally created
a small-scale knowledge base to validate the effectiveness of GeoEvolve on two algorithmic tasks.
We expect that GeoEvolve will achieve even greater performance gains when combined with a larger
and more comprehensive geospatial knowledge base in future work.

ORIGINAL ALGORITHM
A.4.1
ORIGINAL ALGORITHM OF ORIDINARY KRIGING.
Kriging is a geostatistical spatial interpolation method that provides the best linear unbiased esti-
mator (BLUE) of an unknown value at a location by optimally weighting surrounding observations.
It assumes that the spatial process Z(s) can be represented as
Z(s) = µ + ε(s),
(3)
where µ is an unknown constant mean and ε(s) is a zero-mean, second-order stationary random
field. The key assumption of second-order stationarity requires that the mean is constant and that
the covariance depends only on the lag vector h, i.e.,
Cov

Z(s), Z(s + h)

= C(h),
(4)
13


--- Page 14 ---
Figure 7: The keywords used for constructing geospatial knowledge database
or equivalently through the semivariogram γ(h).
Ordinary kriging predicts the value at an unsampled location s0 as a weighted linear combination of
the observed data:

λiZ(si),

The kriging weights λi are determined by minimizing the estimation variance

using the spatial covariance or variogram model.
A.4.2
ORIGINAL ALGORITHM OF GEOCP
GeoConformal Prediction (GeoCP) is a model-agnostic framework for quantifying spatial prediction
uncertainty by extending conformal prediction (CP) with explicit geographic weighting. Conformal
prediction provides finite-sample, distribution-free prediction intervals by computing nonconformity
scores on a calibration set and selecting the (1 −ε) quantile to guarantee coverage. However,
standard CP assumes data exchangeability and yields intervals of constant width, which is violated
in geospatial settings where strong spatial heterogeneity and covariate shift are common.
To overcome these limitations, GeoCP integrates spatial dependence directly into the conformal
framework. Given a geospatial model f : X →Y trained on a set of observations and a calibration
set {(Xi, yi)}m
i=1, let a(·) be a nonconformity score (e.g., absolute residual) and ai = a(f(Xi), yi)
for calibration point i. For a test location Xtest with geographic coordinates (utest, vtest), GeoCP
assigns each calibration point i a geographic weight
wi(utest, vtest) =
Kσ
 d((utest, vtest), (ui, vi))

Pm
j=1 Kσ
 d((utest, vtest), (uj, vj))
,
(8)
where d(·, ·) is the geographic distance and Kσ is a distance-decay kernel (e.g., Gaussian). These
weights reflect Tobler’s first law of geography—that nearby observations are more similar—thus
relaxing the exchangeability requirement of classical CP.
14


--- Page 15 ---
The GeoCP prediction interval for Xtest is then defined as
Cgeo(Xtest) =

y : a
 f(Xtest), y

≤Qgeo
1−ε({ai}, {wi(utest, vtest)})
	
,
(9)
where Qgeo
1−ε is the geographically weighted (1 −ε)-quantile computed as
Qgeo
1−ε = inf
(
q :
m
X
i=1
wi(utest, vtest) 1{ai ≤q} ≥1 −ε
)
.
(10)
Algorithmically, GeoCP proceeds as follows: (1) split the dataset into training, calibration, and test
sets; (2) fit the spatial prediction model f on the training set; (3) compute nonconformity scores {ai}
on the calibration set; (4) for each test point, calculate geographic weights wi via (8); (5) determine
the geographically weighted quantile (10) and form the prediction interval (9).
By construction, GeoCP inherits the rigorous finite-sample coverage guarantee of conformal predic-
tion,
P[ytest ∈Cgeo(Xtest)] ≥1 −ε,
while producing spatially varying prediction intervals that directly reflect local heterogeneity. Be-
cause it does not require modifying the underlying predictive model, GeoCP can be applied seam-
lessly to classical geostatistical methods (e.g., Kriging) and modern GeoAI models, providing a
unified and interpretable framework for uncertainty quantification and supporting fair, responsible
geographic decision-making.
A.5
EVOLVED KRIGING MODEL
A.5.1
GEOEVOLVE-KRIGING (OUR MODEL)
Compared with the original Ordinary Kriging, GeoEvolve–Kriging preserves the core structure
while introducing the following key innovations:
• Expanded and automatically selected variogram family.
Instead of a single non-
standard exponential model, GeoEvolve fits a flexible family
γθ(h) = θ0 + θ1
h
1 −exp
 −(h/θ2)pi
,
(11)
where p
=
1 yields the exponential model,
p
=
2 the Gaussian model,
and p
∈
(0, 2) the Mat´ern family (with smoothness ν).
Candidate models
{Exponential, Gaussian, Linear, Mat´ern} are compared using information criteria such as
AIC = 2k −2 log L,
BIC = k log n −2 log L,
(12)
and the optimal variogram is selected by minimum AIC/BIC. This multi-model, multi-start
search avoids local minima and captures a wide spectrum of spatial smoothness.
• Adaptive empirical variogram estimation. GeoEvolve constructs the empirical semi-
variogram using adaptive binning based on Silverman’s rule or quantiles:
ˆγ(hk) =
1
2|N(hk)|
X
(i,j)∈N(hk)
[Z(xi) −Z(xj)]2,
(13)
where N(hk) is the set of pairs with distances in the kth adaptive bin. Robust trimmed
means and an automatic choice of nlags ∈[8, 20] ∝√n reduce the impact of outliers and
distance heterogeneity.
• Robust model fitting. Parameter estimation in (11) is performed via multi-start global
optimization with either
min
θ
X
k
wk |ˆγ(hk) −γθ(hk)|
(14)
(robust L1 loss) or weighted least squares, depending on empirical residual patterns, where
wk are bin-based weights. This strategy guards against local minima and ensures sill θ1
and range θ2 remain physically meaningful.
15


--- Page 16 ---
• Localized kriging with adaptive regularization. To improve scalability and stability,
GeoEvolve restricts the kriging system to the K nearest neighbors (e.g., K = 25) of x0
using a cKDTree and adds a condition-number–dependent diagonal adjustment:
Klocλ = kloc,
Kloc ←Kloc + ϵ(κ)I,
(15)
where ϵ(κ) is an adaptive nugget (e.g., 10−10 to 10−4) determined by the matrix condition
number κ. This reduces computational cost from O(n3) to O(K3) and stabilizes inversion
in ill-conditioned settings.
• Adaptive data transformation. GeoEvolve applies an adaptive log transform
Z′ = log
 Z + δ

,
(16)
where the offset δ is chosen from the 1st percentile of positive values plus a small ϵ to
reduce skewness and ensure valid back-transformation.
A.5.2
COMPARISON OF EVOLVED KRIGING FROM DIFFERENT MODELS
In this section, we analyze the main technical components of different algorithm:
Variogram family.
Original uses only the exponential variogram with a non-standard form
nugget + sill(1 −e−h·range). OpenEvolve standardizes the form to e−h/range and adds Gaus-
sian and Linear options. OpenEvolve with GeoKnowledge adopts the same set but applies auto-
matic model selection among candidate models. GeoEvolve further introduces the Matern family
(ν = 0.2–3.0) with full AIC/BIC-based automatic selection and multi-start optimization.
Empirical variogram.
Original employs 12 equal-width bins including zero distance and is
unweighted. OpenEvolve truncates distances to 85% of the maximum and removes NaN bins.
OpenEvolve with GeoKnowledge follows the same procedure but adds minimal pair control. Geo-
Evolve uses adaptive binning via Silverman’s rule or quantiles, applies a robust trimmed mean, and
automatically sets nlags = 8–20 ∝√n.
Model fitting. Original applies an L1 loss with a single L-BFGS-B run. OpenEvolve still uses
L1 but adds parameter bounds, smart initialization, and a fallback strategy. OpenEvolve with Geo-
Knowledge switches to L2 loss and selects the best model by minimum MSE. GeoEvolve adopts a
robust L1 loss, multi-start global search, Matern smoothness grid, and AIC/BIC complexity penal-
ties.
Kriging solver. Original builds a global system without neighborhood selection. OpenEvolve in-
troduces diagonal regularization (10−10) and a pseudo-inverse fallback. OpenEvolve with Geo-
Knowledge is identical. GeoEvolve employs localized kriging using cKDTree nearest 25 neighbors
and condition-number–adaptive regularization (10−10–10−4), with mean fallback if the system is
singular.
A.5.3
KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY FROM GEOEVOLVE
We summarize the key geospatial knowledge underlying the improved GeoEvolve algorithm, which
can contribute to geospatial modeling.
Expanded variogram family with automatic selection. Fits appropriate smoothness and range,
lowering RMSE/MAE and improving R2.
Adaptive empirical variogram (trimmed mean, quantile bins). Stabilizes nugget/sill/range esti-
mates and reduces run-to-run variance.
Multi-start with parameter bounds in optimization. Improves convergence and avoids negative
or degenerate parameter estimates.
Localized kriging with condition-based regularization. Reduces computational cost (from O(n3)
to local operations) and improves robustness for ill-conditioned systems.
Geo-knowledge injection. Provides informative priors and narrows the search space, improving
small-sample and non-stationary performance.

EVOLVED GEOCP MODEL
A.6.1
GEOEVOLVE-GEOCP (OUR MODEL)
The fundamental conformal construction is preserved, but the following modifications are intro-
duced:
• Refined geographic weighting. While keeping the Gaussian kernel form

(17)
GeoEvolve reoptimizes the bandwidth parameter σ through multi-start global search and
adaptive clipping
σ ∈[σmin, σmax],
(18)
ensuring both numerical stability and fidelity to local spatial heterogeneity.
• Enhanced weighted quantile computation.
GeoEvolve consolidates earlier adaptive
strategies into a simplified yet robust stepwise quantile estimator:
Qgeo
1−ε = inf
(
q :
m
X
i=1
wi(utest, vtest) 1

ai ≤q
	
≥1 −ε
)
.
(19)
The algorithmic implementation uses improved vectorization and conditioning checks,
guaranteeing accuracy and scalability on large test sets.
A.6.2
COMPARISON OF EVOLVED GEOCP FROM DIFFERENT MODELS
We summarize the key technical elements of the different code-evolution algorithms.
Original GeoCP. This version uses a fixed-bandwidth Gaussian kernel e−0.5d2 without weight nor-
malization. It computes weighted quantiles with a stepwise rule, selecting the index where cumula-
tive weights exceed q without interpolation, and adopts the quantile level q = ⌈(1−α)(N +1)⌉/N,
which is slightly conservative. Only the mean interval score is reported as the uncertainty metric.
As a result, the method may produce overly wide or miscalibrated intervals in regions with strong
spatial heterogeneity or sparse sampling.
OpenEvolve. This stage introduces adaptive bandwidth, dynamically adjusting kernel width for
each test location based on its k-nearest neighbor distance and row-wise distance dispersion. It re-
places the stepwise weighted quantile with interpolated weighted quantiles, avoiding discontinuous
interval endpoints.
OpenEvolve with GeoKnowledge. Here the bandwidth is eo-knowledge guided: per-test k-NN
bandwidths are clipped to the empirical range [0.05, 0.5]. Weight normalization ensures that each
test point’s kernel weights sum to one, providing numerical stability and spatial consistency. The
quantile level is refined to q = (1 −α)(N + 1)/N (without ceiling), reducing conservativeness
and shortening intervals. Furthermore, comprehensive UQ metrics are reported, including mean
interval length, empirical coverage, and deviation from nominal coverage. Overall, this stage further
shortens intervals and achieves near-nominal coverage while remaining robust at boundaries and in
sparse areas.
GeoEvolve. GeoEvolve–GeoCP remains faithful to the core conformal prediction framework while
sharpening spatial weighting and quantile estimation, the two pillars of interval construction. The
refined geographic weighting adaptively tunes bandwidth to local heterogeneity, ensuring that con-
formal scores reflect the true spatial dependence and avoid instability.
A.6.3
KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY FROM GEOEVOLVE
We distill the geospatial knowledge that underlies the improved GeoCP algorithm produced by Geo-
Evolve.
17


--- Page 18 ---
Adaptive bandwidth. This mechanism adjusts kernel width to local calibration-point density, pre-
venting overly wide intervals in dense regions and overly narrow ones in sparse regions. It drives
the interval score down and keeps empirical coverage near (1 −α).
Interpolated weighted quantile. By eliminating discrete jumps when cumulative weights cross the
quantile threshold, this refinement produces smoother, more stable prediction interval endpoints and
lowers variance.
Refined quantile level without ceiling. This adjustment avoids the conservative upward bias from
the ceiling function, shortens interval length, and keeps empirical coverage close to the nominal
level.
