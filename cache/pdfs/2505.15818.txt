Abstract
Language-guided object recognition in remote sensing imagery is crucial for large-
scale mapping and automated data annotation. However, existing open-vocabulary
and visual grounding methods rely on explicit category cues, limiting their ability
to handle complex or implicit queries that require advanced reasoning. To address
this issue, we introduce a new suite of tasks, including Instruction-Oriented Object
Counting, Detection, and Segmentation (InstructCDS), covering open-vocabulary,
open-ended, and open-subclass scenarios. We further present EarthInstruct, the
first InstructCDS benchmark for earth observation. It is constructed from two
diverse remote sensing datasets with varying spatial resolutions and annotation
rules across 20 categories, necessitating models to interpret dataset-specific in-
structions. Given the scarcity of semantically rich labeled data in remote sensing,
we propose InstructSAM, a training-free framework for instruction-driven object
recognition. InstructSAM leverages large vision-language models to interpret
user instructions and estimate object counts, employs SAM2 for mask proposal,
and formulates mask-label assignment as a binary integer programming prob-
lem. By integrating semantic similarity with counting constraints, InstructSAM
efficiently assigns categories to predicted masks without relying on confidence
thresholds. Experiments demonstrate that InstructSAM matches or surpasses spe-
cialized baselines across multiple tasks while maintaining near-constant inference
time regardless of object count, reducing output tokens by 89% and overall runtime
by over 32% compared to direct generation approaches. We believe the contribu-
tions of the proposed tasks, benchmark, and effective approach will advance future
research in developing versatile object recognition systems. The code is available

Introduction
Object recognition in remote sensing imagery captures a vast array of objects and phenomena
across diverse environments, providing rich information for supporting achieving the Sustainable
Development Goals issued by the United Nations [56, 3], such as wildlife monitoring [78, 91],
poverty estimation [1, 48], and disaster response [18]. The recent advent of powerful vision-language
models (VLMs), such as CLIP [58], has ushered in a new era of remote sensing oriented open-
vocabulary object recognition algorithms (e.g. detection [37, 54] and segmentation [21]). However,
existing open-vocabulary approaches predominantly rely on explicit category cues, which restrict
their capability to handle complex or implicit queries that demand advanced reasoning and contextual
understanding. In other words, the rich diversity of visible objects in remote sensing images, due to
the bird’s-eye view, predicates that any predefined, fixed list of categories is inevitably incomplete,
limiting its practicality for open-ended analysis in the real world.
To address this issue, we expand the instruction-oriented object detection task [57] and intro-
duce a novel suite of tasks—Instruction-Oriented Object Counting, Detection, and Segmentation
(InstructCDS) that encompasses open-vocabulary, open-ended, and open-subclass settings, as illus-
trated in Figure 1. The InstructCDS task entails a more flexible and scalable interpretation beyond
fixed category sets and comprehends the complex users’ task requirements. We further present Earth-
Instruct, the first benchmark for InstructCDS in earth observation. The benchmark is constructed
from two generic remote sensing object datasets covering 20 categories with different annotation
rules and spatial resolution. EarthInstruct guides models to comprehend complex user instructions
beyond the predefined three settings.
Recent advancements in VLMs have demonstrated impressive performance in object detection [44, 39,
57? ], semantic segmentation [85, 11? ], visual grounding [2, 7] and reasoning-based segmentation
[63, 29] within the natural image domain. However, transferring these methods to remote sensing
imagery presents several challenges. First, direct inference leads to significant accuracy degradation
due to the domain gap between natural and aerial images [14]. Second, most existing remote sensing
open-vocabulary detection [37, 38, 86? ] and segmentation [87, 84, 21] methods are trained on
datasets with only a limited number of categories, restricting their generalization to diverse unseen
categories. Third, conventional detectors [34, 10, 49] rely on a threshold to filter predicted bounding
boxes, which is not obtainable in zero-shot scenarios.
To tackle these challenges, we decompose the instruction-oriented object detection and segmentation
tasks into several tractable steps and propose a framework without task-specific training, Instruct-
SAM. First, a large vision-language model (LVLM) is employed to interpret user instructions and
predict object categories and counts, with prompts systematically designed to maximize model’s
capability. In parallel, SAM2 [60] is utilized to automatically generate mask proposals. Next,
a CLIP model pre-trained on remote sensing images computes the semantic similarity between
the predicted objects categories and mask proposals. We then formulate the object detection and
segmentation as a mask-label matching problem, assigning predicted categories to mask proposals
2

by integrating semantic similarity and global counting constraints. By inherently integrating three
powerful foundation models, InstructSAM achieves superior performance across multiple tasks
compared to both generic and remote sensing-specific VLMs trained on large-scale object recognition
data. Notably, the inference time of InstructSAM remains nearly constant with respect to the number
of predicted objects, reducing output tokens by 89% and overall runtime by 32% compared to directly
generating bounding boxes using Qwen2.5-VL [2] in the open-ended setting. Our work paves the
way for scalable, instruction-driven remote sensing object detection and segmentation, eliminating
the need for costly pre-training or manual threshold tuning. Furthermore, the training-free paradigm
allows InstructSAM to recognize objects in natural images when equipped with generic CLIP models.
In summary, our contributions are as follows:
• We introduce the InstructCDS task, which challenges models to interpret user-provided natural
language instructions and infer the number and locations of relevant objects.
• We construct EarthInstruct to benchmark InstructCDS in earth observation, covering open-
vocabulary, open-ended, and open-subclass settings and counting, detection, and segmentation
tasks.
• We develop InstructSAM, a training-free and confidence-free framework achieving near-constant
inference time for the InstructCDS task.
• Experiments on the benchmarks demonstrate that InstructSAM matches close-set models in object
counting and surpasses generic and remote sensing-specific models in open-vocabulary and open-
ended object recognition.

2.1
Instruction-oriented object detection and segmentation
Instruction-oriented methods
Instruction-oriented object detection (IOD), first introduced in [57],
includes four instruction settings: category-specified (open-vocabulary [76]) detection, detection
of all objects (open-ended [39]), detection within a super-category (we name it open-subclass),
and detection to achieve certain goals. Ins-DetCLIP [57] trains a detector to identify foreground
objects and passes their features to a large language model (LLM) to generate categories based on
user instructions. In addition to models specifically designed for the IOD task, Qwen2.5-VL [2],
trained on multi-task instruction data, also showcases the ability of dense object detection. However,
both approaches require extensive task-specific training data, and their inference times increase
substantially with the number of objects.
Open-vocabulary methods
Large-vocabulary object detection and segmentation datasets [67, 17,
72] and visual grounding datasets [27, 23] enable various open-vocabulary learning approaches,
including knowledge distillation [16] and region-text pre-training [26, 50, 44, 34]. Self-training with
confidence threshold-filtered pseudo labels from image-text pairs (e.g., CC3M [5], WebLI2B [6])
further boosts the performance [49, 44, 89, 83]. However, the quality of pseudo labels is highly
sensitive to the chosen threshold [49], and these methods require predefined object categories, limiting
their flexibility in diverse scenarios.
Open-ended methods
GenerateU [39] first formulates the open-ended object detection (OED)
problem. Concurrent works such as DetCLIPv3 [83], Florence-2 [79], and DINO-X [62] introduce
generative frameworks that jointly predict object categories and bounding boxes using language
models. However, constructing large-scale datasets with bounding box and caption pairs is resource-
intensive. VL-SAM [40] proposes a training-free approach via attention as prompts, but its iterative
mask refinement and multi-prompt ensemble strategies are computationally expensive.
2.2
Instruction-oriented remote sensing object detection and segmentation
Recent advances in VLMs [58, 43] have also enabled open-vocabulary learning in the remote sensing
domain. Diverse semantic tags from OpenStreetMap [19] and those generated by LVLMs drive the
development of contrastive language-image pre-training in remote sensing images [90, 73]. Following
the generic open-vocabulary learning frameworks, methods for remote sensing open-vocabulary
3


--- Page 4 ---
detection [37, 75, 54, 22] and segmentation [87, 84, 21, 31] methods emerge. However, their human-
annotated training data, being limited to a few dozen categories [33, 74, 69? ], hinder generalization
to out-of-distribution or zero-shot scenarios. Although some remote sensing LVLMs could support
object recognition tasks like single-class object detection [28, 47, 25], visual grounding [52, 55],
referring expression segmentation [92, 53], grounded conversation generation [65], and scene graph
generation [47], they failed to follow complex reasoning instructions, such as open-vocabulary and
open-subclass object detection. To annotate vast-vocabulary training data for remote sensing object
detection, LAE-Label [54] employs a generic LVLM [8] to predict categories for cropped mask
proposals. However, this approach loses global context for accurate category classification.
In contrast, our InstructSAM adopts a confidence-free paradigm, requires no task-specific pre-training
or finetuning, and maintains near-constant inference time regardless of object counts.

EarthInstruct, a benchmark for InstructCDS in remote sensing
3.1
Instruction setup
To enable practical applications in remote sensing such as large-scale mapping [1] and image
annotation, we define three distinct settings for InstructCDS:
1) Open-vocabulary: Counting, detection, and segmentation with user-specified categories.
2) Open-ended: Counting, detection, and segmentation of all objects without specifying categories.
3) Open-subclass: Counting, detection, and segmentation of objects within a super-category.
We construct EarthInstruct using NWPU-VHR-10 [9] and DIOR [33] datasets, selected for their
widespread use and diverse sensors, resolutions, and annotation rules. Critically, these dataset-
specific annotation rules might deviate from common sense (e.g., excluding low-resolution vehicles)
or exhibit semantic ambiguities (e.g., “bridge” vs. “overpass”), reflecting the original annotators’
specific goals (Figure 2). Consequently, simple instructions like “count vehicles” would fail to capture
the nuances required by dataset conventions or user intent. EarthInstruct therefore necessitates models
to interpret detailed instructions that clarify target definitions and handle dataset-specific rules (e.g.,
“do not count vehicles in images with a spatial resolution lower than 1m.”). To ensure fair evaluation
aligned with dataset conventions and user requirements, prompts are designed accordingly, but
image-specific prompts are prohibited to maintain scalability for large-area applications where prior
content knowledge for each image is unavailable.
3.2
Evaluation metrics
Multi-class object counting
Standard counting metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), used in benchmarks like FSC-147 [59] and RSOC [15],
inadequately capture nuanced multi-class evaluation. They cannot distinguish between over-counting
and under-counting errors. Additionally, being unnormalized, they allow categories with larger counts
to disproportionately skew the overall score when being averaged across classes.
4


--- Page 5 ---
To address these issues, we adopt precision, recall, and F1-score, whereby offering normalized,
per-class insights. We define per-image, per-class counting components as follows: let Cgt denote the
ground truth count and Cpred the predicted count for a class in an image. Then, True Positives (TP) =
min(Cgt, Cpred), False Positives (FP) = max(0, Cpred −Cgt) for over-counting, and False Negatives
(FN) = max(0, Cgt −Cpred) for under-counting. These definitions enable standard calculation of
precision, recall, and F1-score, aggregated across images per class and then averaged for a final score.
Rethinking metrics for confidence-free detectors
Evaluating generative models like Florence-
2 [79] or Qwen2.5-VL [2], which output detections without confidence scores, poses a challenge
for standard metrics. Average Precision (AP) [12] relies on confidence scores to rank predictions
and generate precision-recall curves. Without such ranking, standard AP is ill-defined. Furthermore,
practical applications often involve filtering predictions with a fixed threshold, treating all remaining
detections equally [1, 49].
To resolve these issues and ensure fair comparison, we adopt confidence-free metrics: mean F1-score
(mF1) and mean Average Precision with no confidence (mAPnc) [35]. mF1 measures performance
at a single operating point, suitable for fixed-threshold deployment. mAPnc adapts AP by assigning
maximum confidence to all predictions. For confidence-free models, these metrics are computed
directly (Results in Table 10). For conventional detectors (e.g., [61, 4]) that provide scores, when the
confidence threshold is swept from 0 to 1 (step 0.02), the threshold maximizing mF1 (using an IoU
threshold of 0.5) across categories is selected, and the corresponding cusp score is reported.
Evaluating open-ended and open-subclass settings
In open-ended and open-subclass settings,
LVLMs may generate category names (e.g., “car”) that differ textually from ground truth labels (e.g.,
“vehicle”). To handle this synonymy during evaluation, we adopt semantic similarity matching by
following established protocols [39, 57]. Specifically, we encode generated categories and ground
truth categories using the GeoRSCLIP [90] text encoder with the template “a satellite image
of a {category}”. A generated category name is deemed equivalent to a ground truth category if
their embedding cosine similarity exceeds 0.95. This allows predicted objects associated with the
generated name to be accurately evaluated against the matched ground truth category.

InstructSAM
Addressing the challenges of instruction-following, domain gaps, and threshold sensitivity in remote
sensing object recognition, we propose a training-free framework named InstructSAM. It decomposes
InstructCDS into three synergistic steps: instruction-based object counting using an LVLM, class-
agnostic mask proposing via SAM2, and a novel counting-constrained mask-label matching procedure.
This approach avoids the costly model training and threshold tuning, offering efficient and robust
performance.
4.1
Instruction-oriented object counting with LVLM
As illustrated in Section 3, accurately interpreting user intent in remote sensing requires handling
dataset-specific rules and semantic ambiguities, which the simple category prompts could fail to
capture. We leverage state-of-the-art LVLMs (e.g., GPT-4o [24], Qwen2.5-VL [2]) for this task.
Inspired by [20], we utilize structured prompts in JSON format, which allows easy integration of
dataset-specific Instructions alongside the core Task (detailed in Appendix C). Given an image I
and a detailed prompt P, the LVLM acts as a counter, outputting the target categories {catj} and their
corresponding counts {numj} present in the image: {catj, numj}M
j=1 = LVLM-Counter(I, P).
4.2
Class-agnostic mask proposing
Concurrent with counting, SAM2 [60] is employed to generate high-quality, class-agnostic object
masks for its strong generalization to remote sensing imagery [71, 77]. Using its automated mask
generation mode prompted by a regular point grid, we obtain a dense set of masks proposals
{maski}N
i=1. To enhance recall for small objects, mask generation is also applied to image crops
(detailed in Appendix C.4).

Figure 3: The InstructSAM framework. Given an input image and a structured counting prompt,
the LVLM Counter extracts target categories {catj} (semantic info) and their counts {numj}
(quantitative info). Concurrently, the Mask Proposer generates mask proposals {maski} (visual info).
A CLIP model computes the similarity matrix S between mask embeddings (from scaled crops) {vi}
and category embeddings {tj}. Finally, the Binary Integer Programming (BIP) Solver optimally
assigns categories to masks by maximizing summed similarity, subject to the counting constraints,
yielding the final recognition results.
4.3
Mask-label matching with counting constraints
A key innovation of InstructSAM is reframing object detection and segmentation as a constrained
mask-label matching problem, by integrating the outputs from previous steps. Rather than using
fragile confidence thresholds [10, 49], we utilize global counts {numj} derived from the LVLM to
constrain the assignment of semantic labels {catj} to visual mask proposals {maski}.
Given N mask proposals and M target categories with counts, we compute a semantic similarity ma-
trix S ∈RN×M, where sij represents the cosine similarity between the CLIP [90] image embedding
of a patch cropped around maski (scaled by 1.2 for context) and the text embedding of catj (using the
template “a satellite image of a {category}”). We then seek a binary assignment matrix
X ∈{0, 1}N×M, where xij = 1 assigns maski to catj, by solving the Binary Integer Programming
(BIP) problem:

where constraint (2) ensures each mask is assigned to at most one category. Constraint (3) enforces
that the number of assigned masks for each category matches the counts provided by the LVLM.
Constraint (4) handles cases where the number of proposals is less than the total target count, ensuring
all proposals are assigned.
As depicted in Figure 3, this BIP formulation elegantly fuses visual information, semantic information,
and quantitative information. The visual information comes from the CLIP embeddings of mask
proposals {vi}, which contribute to sij. Semantic information is derived from the categories’ sentence
embeddings {tj}, also contributing to sij. Quantitative information from object counts {numj}
serves as constraints in (3). The problem is efficiently solvable using open-source BIP solvers
like PuLP [51]. The resulting non-zero entries in X define the final set of recognized objects
{(maski, catj)|xij = 1}.

Implementation
We implement InstructSAM using GPT-4o-2024-11-20 [24] (short for InstructSAM-GPT4o) or
Qwen2.5-VL-7B [2] (short for InstructSAM-Qwen) as the LVLM counter, SAM2-hiera-large [60]
for mask proposal, and GeoRSCLIP-ViT-L [90] for similarity computation. For the open-vocabulary
setting, we follow previous works [75, 21, 86] to split base and novel classes, and report mF1, mean
Insert-over-Union (mIoU), or mAPnc. For open-subclass setting, we set two parent class “means of
transport” and “sports fields”. We compare InstructSAM with a wide range of models, whose training
data and abilities are listed in Table 6.
5.2
Results on EarthInstruct
Open-vocabulary setting
We report mean metrics across all classes for generic methods [44, 49, 2]
and remote sensing open-vocabulary segmentation models [84, 31] trained on broader vocabularies
in Table 1. Zero-shot performance on novel classes for models trained on base classes [86, 75, 21]
appears in Table 10. Models using novel class images or trained on entire detection datasets are
evaluated on two additional datasets (Table 11).
Table 1 shows InstructSAM (esp. with GPT-4o) leading in all tasks with top counting metrics.
On novel classes (Table 10), InstructSAM-Qwen achieves superior or competitive mAPnc against
specialized models. This underscores InstructSAM’s training-free, counting-constrained matching
advantage over traditional or fine-tuned approaches.

Open-ended setting
Table 2 sum-
marizes the results under open-ended
setting.
InstructSAM consistently
achieves equivalent or higher F1-
scores than remote sensing-specific
methods, including those trained on
grounded description tasks [47, 65].
Notably, InstructSAM surpasses LAE-
Label [54] by leveraging a global view
of the image to accurately predict ob-
ject categories. While the absence of
class-specific instructions in this set-
ting limits further gains, InstructSAM
still demonstrates robust performance (Figure 4).
Open-subclass setting
Table 3 shows that InstructSAM outperforms or matches Qwen2.5-VL
across both parent classes. When prompted with categories identified by GPT-4o, OWLv2 performs
strongly for “means of transport” but struggles with “sports fields”, likely due to the prevalence
of transport-related categories in natural image datasets. These findings are consistent with the
open-vocabulary results, where generic detectors, such as Grounding DINO and OWL, struggle with
remote sensing categories except for airplane, vehicle, and ship.

Inference time analysis
Figure 5 compares inference times for open-ended methods using 7B
LLMs. Mask proposal dominates the runtime of InstructSAM, whereas the PuLP optimizer solves
the BIP problem in 0.07 seconds. InstructSAM maintains nearly constant inference time, while
other methods scale linearly with the number of objects. Unlike representing bounding boxes as
natural language tokens, InstructSAM reduces output tokens by 89% and total inference time by 32%
compared to Qwen2.5-VL. This advantage will grow more pronounced as the model size scales up,
highlighting the efficiency of our framework.

Prompt design
Table 4 reveals how additional instructions enhance object counting, particularly for
categories with ambiguous or dataset-specific annotation rules. Initially, DIOR-trained Faster-RCNN
and LVLM counters exhibit low vehicle precision on NWPU-VHR-10. Explicit annotation rules in
instructions significantly boost vehicle precision for Qwen2.5-VL and GPT-4o, and also improve mF1
by 3% and 8%, respectively, on DIOR. Contrary to [88], these results show that capable foundation
models with precise, instruction-driven prompts truly empower LVLMs to match or exceed closed-set
model performance.
Model generalization and scaling
To assess InstructSAM’s generalization and scalability, we
ablate LVLM counters, mask proposers, and CLIP models for the open-vocabulary detection (OVD)
task on NWPU-VHR-10 (Table 5). InstructSAM consistently benefits from CLIP models fine-tuned
on remote sensing data [42, 73] over generic CLIP [13], whereby yielding higher Box F1-scores.
Performance improves with larger model components, demonstrating the framework’s scalability.
Notably, even with a smaller SAM2-S and SkyCLIP-B, InstructSAM coupled with Qwen2.5-VL
(40.6 Box F1) outperforms direct detection using Qwen2.5-VL alone (36.4 Box F1), underscoring the
efficacy of our approach.
Mask-label matching with counting constraints
Using fixed thresholds to filter CLIP predic-
tions [10] has inherent limitations. In Figure 6, the green and blue solid curves show InstructSAM
without matching, where predictions are filtered by a similarity score (CLIP score) threshold before
evaluation. Optimal thresholds vary widely across categories. As a result, a single global value

performs poorly, and the results are highly threshold-sensitive, which is consistent with the findings
in [35]. In contrast, InstructSAM’s counting-constrained matching removes this dependency by
dynamically assigning predictions according to the estimated counts, yielding stronger performance
in multi-class and open-world settings.

Error analysis of OVD task
Error identification reveals distinct error patterns across methods (Figure 7). OWLv2 primarily
suffers from classification errors, while Qwen2.5-VL shows improved classification but struggles
with missed detections. InstructSAM-GPT4o benefits from SAM2’s localization capabilities, though
the background confusion persists due to GeoRSCLIP’s scene-focused training, which prioritizes
broader contexts over individual objects.

Limitations
InstructSAM builds on pre-trained foundation models, and its performance inherits their capabilities
and biases. For instance, SAM2 can miss the full extent of objects with intricate geometry (e.g.,
basketball court in Figure 4). CLIP models finetuned on scene-level remote sensing image–text
pairs perform suboptimally when aligning object-level crops with semantic cues. More generally,
foundation models such as GPT-4o and SAM are trained primarily on optical imagery and struggle to
count or segment objects in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images.
Future work can mitigate these limitations by (i) incorporating foundation models trained on semanti-
cally diverse, multi-modal remote sensing data and (ii) leveraging advanced class-agnostic region
proposers [80]. Extending InstructSAM to semantic segmentation would further benefit the earth
observation community. Although InstructSAM is only a first step, we aim to use it as an automated
labeling engine to annotate at scale, enabling large, semantically rich object-recognition datasets.

Conclusions
In this paper, we introduce InstructCDS for instruction-driven object counting, detection, and seg-
mentation, along with EarthInstruct, the first benchmark for this task in remote sensing domain.
Our training-free InstructSAM framework integrates LVLMs, SAM2, and domain-specific CLIP to
handle instruction-oriented scenarios with counting constrained mask-label matching. Experiments
demonstrate that InstructSAM outperforms specialized baselines while maintaining near-constant
inference time regardless of object counts. As the first approach extending instruction-oriented
detection to the broader InstructCDS paradigm, InstructSAM will benefit from advancements in
both remote sensing foundation models [41, 81, 82, 64, 66] and general-purpose models [70, 93, 46],
paving the way for more scalable, instruction-driven earth observation data analysis.

Comparison with related work
Remote sensing imagery captures a vast, diverse range of contexts. Exemplified by the SkyScript
dataset [73], curated from Google Earth and OpenStreetMap [19], featuring 29,000 distinct semantic
tags. Despite this richness, annotated training datasets for remote sensing object recognition typically
span only a few dozen categories (Table 6). This lexical scarcity hinders effective alignment of
semantic and visual information compared to generic models, which are typically trained on millions
of human-annotated images and near-infinite vocabularies sourced from the Internet. Similarly,
instruction-following datasets for remote sensing, such as FIT-RS [47] and GeoPixelD [65], are also
built upon manually annotated data, often inheriting these vocabulary-specific limitations.
Regarding model capabilities, remote sensing LVLMs typically fail to follow complex object recogni-
tion instructions as illustrated in Figure 8. Nevertheless, SkysenseGPT [47] and GeoPixel [65], trained
on scene graph generation or pixel-grounded conversation generation tasks, deliver comprehensive
object detection or segmentation outputs, effectively serving a similar purpose of open-ended object
recognition.

detection (open-vocabulary detection (OVD), open-ended detection (OED), and open-subclass detec-

Benchmark details
The details of the datasets comprising EarthInstruct are as follows:
• NWPU-VHR-10 [9] is a 10-class dataset for very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing object
detection. It originally comprises 650 positive images (each containing at least one target object)
and 150 negative images (containing no target objects). For constructing EarthInstruct, we utilize
the 650 positive images. Instance-level mask annotations were subsequently provided by [68].

• DIOR [33] is a large-scale benchmark for object detection in optical remote sensing images,
encompassing 20 object categories. The dataset is split into 5,862 training images, 5,863 validation
images, and 11,725 test images. For the EarthInstruct benchmark, we utilize the validation set of
DIOR. Mask annotations are provided by the SAMRS [71] dataset.

and the specific category splits within EarthInstruct.
Table 8 compares EarthInstruct with other language-guided object recognition datasets and bench-

tion [45] and visual grounding [36] benchmarks typically support only single-class or single-object
queries, restricting efficiency in large-scale applications.
EarthInstruct addresses these issues by supporting open-vocabulary, open-ended, and open-subclass
settings, and uses dataset-specific prompts that encode user intent without relying on image content
priors. This enables more comprehensive and efficient evaluation for instruction-driven object
recognition.

Implementation details
This section provides further details on the implementation of our InstructSAM framework and
other baselines. A critical component of leveraging LVLMs for the InstructCDS tasks is the design
of effective prompts. We employ structured prompts in JSON format to systematically guide the
LVLM counter. This structured approach allows for clear delineation of the model’s Persona,
the specific Task to be performed, detailed Instructions for execution, the desired Output
format, and illustrative Examples. The Instructions field enables the incorporation of dataset-
specific annotation rules and disambiguation of category definitions, which are crucial for accurate
interpretation the user intension, as discussed in Section 3.1. The subsequent subsections detail the
specific prompts used for each setting within the EarthInstruct benchmark.
Here we further clarify how the categories that might have bewildered the model. For example,
an “overpass” is defined as “a bridge, road, railway or similar structure that is over another road or
railway1”, while a “bridge” is “a structure built to span a physical obstacle (such as a body of water,
valley, road, or railway) without blocking the path underneath2.” It is possible that the LVLM counter
will recognize overpasses as bridges since overpass is a subset of bridge. Adding clarification such as
“bridge in this dataset refers to a structure spanning a body of water” to the Instructions field will
guild the LVLM to count accurately.

Hyperparameters of InstructSAM
Mask proposer
As described in Section 4.2, class-agnostic mask proposals are generated using
SAM2-hiera-large [60] in its automatic mask generation mode. The model was configured with
the parameters detailed in Table 9 across both NWPU-VHR-10 and DIOR. These settings balance
the proposal quality and computational efficiency, ensuring a dense set of high-quality proposals,
especially for small objects.

Implementations of baseline methods
To ensure rigorous and fair comparisons against InstructSAM, baseline methods are implemented
or adapted as detailed below. Unless otherwise specified, publicly available pre-trained models and
official codebases are utilized, adhering to their recommended configurations.
Open-Vocabulary semantic segmentation methods
For SegEarth-OV [31] and GSNet [84], we
follow their prescribed inference procedures. This involves providing the target categories along with
an explicit “background” category as input. To derive instance-level proposals from the pixel-level
segmentation maps produced by these models, we apply a standard connected component labeling
algorithm to the per-class binary masks. This allows evaluation using instance-based metrics (Mask
F1).
Open-ended methods
• SkysenseGPT [47]: We utilize the prompt “[grounding]Analyze and describe every detail you can
identify in the image,” which is a representative of its training data, and set the maximum output
token limit to 5000.
• GeoPixel [65]: Following the illustrative examples provided in their publication, we employ the
prompt “Can you give a thorough description of this image, including interleaved segmentation
masks to highlight key objects?”
• LAE-Label [54]: For mask proposing, we use SAM2-hiera-large with the same hyperparameters as
InstructSAM (see Appendix C.4). For label generation, we replace LAE-Label’s original InterVL2-
8B and reasoning prompt with the newer Qwen2.5-VL-7B, guided by a structured prompt for
open-ended category identification without explicit reasoning. This change of prompt improves
mF1 by 4.3% on NWPU-VHR-10 and reduces inference time by 92%. The prompt we use is as
follows:
23


--- Page 24 ---
{
"Persona": "You are an advanced AI model capable of understanding and
analyzing remote sensing images."
"Task": "Given an input satellite imagery, identify the most likely object
class visible in the image. Provide the result as a single class name."
"Instructions": [
"Consider this is a region of interest cropped from a larger remote
sensing image.",
"Focus on identifying the main object class visible in the cropped
region.",
"Be specific with your answer, using a single class name."],
"Output format": "\"class_name\"",
"Answer": ["Provide only the class name in quotes, without additional
explanations. If it is not recognized, output \"Unrecognized\" "]
}
Qwen2.5-VL
Given Qwen2.5-VL’s [2] extensive pre-training on object detection tasks, we request
Qwen2.5-VL to generate a prompt template to perform IOD, and specify the output format following
the examples in their paper. Taking DIOR dataset as an example, the prompts for each task are as
follows.
• Open-vocabulary detection:
**Prompt:**
I need assistance with performing an remote sensing object detection task using
the provided category names:
[‘airplane’, ‘airport’, ‘baseball field’,
‘basketball court’, ‘bridge’, ‘chimney’, ‘expressway service area’,
‘expressway toll station’, ‘dam’, ‘golf field’, ‘ground track field’,
‘harbor’, ‘overpass’, ‘ship’, ‘stadium’, ‘storage tank’, ‘tennis court’,
‘train station’, ‘vehicle’, ‘windmill’].
Please provide the results in JSON format, where each object is represented as
follows:
- Each object should include a label (category name) and its corresponding
bounding box coordinates (in the format [x1, y1, x2, y2]).
**Example Output:**
[
{"label": "category_name", "bbox_2d": [x1, y1, x2, y2]},
{"label": "category_name", "bbox_2d": [x1, y1, x2, y2]},
...
]
• Open-ended detection:
**Prompt:**
Please detect all the visible objects in the satellite image and provide the
results in JSON format, where each object is represented as follows:
- Each object should include a label (category name) in singular form and its
corresponding bounding box coordinates (in the format [x1, y1, x2, y2]).
**Example Output:**
[
{"label": "category1", "bbox_2d": [x1, y1, x2, y2]},
{"label": "category2", "bbox_2d": [x1, y1, x2, y2]},
...
]
• Open-subclass detection (e.g., for “sports field”):
**Prompt:**
Please detect all the visible objects in the satellite image that belong to the
parent category **sports field** and provide the results in JSON format,
where each object is represented as follows:
24


--- Page 25 ---
- Each object should include a label (subcategory name) in singular form and its
corresponding bounding box coordinates (in the format [x1, y1, x2, y2]).
- If none of the objects belong to the parent category is visible, output a empty
empty list like [].
**Example Output:**
[
{"label": "subcategory1", "bbox_2d": [x1, y1, x2, y2]},
{"label": "subcategory2", "bbox_2d": [x1, y1, x2, y2]},
...
]
While incorporating detailed dataset-specific instructions into prompts enhances Qwen2.5-VL’s
performance for object counting, such elaborations does not benefit direct detection. In fact, such
instructions reduce mF1 by 1% on NWPU-VHR-10 and have little effect on DIOR. The main paper
reports open-vocabulary detection results without these instructions.

Comparison with zero-shot remote sensing object recognition methods on EarthInstruct
Direct comparison with some zero-shot remote sensing detection and segmentation methods (e.g.,
DesReg [86], OVA-DETR [75], ZoRI [21]) is difficult due to differing dataset splits, evaluation met-
rics, and limited reproducibility. Table 10 shows their reported mAP scores alongside InstructSAM’s
mAPnc on novel classes. Notably, InstructSAM-Qwen matches or outperforms these methods on their
respective benchmarks (e.g., ZoRI on NWPU-VHR-10, OVA-DETR on DIOR). While these baselines
use confidence-based AP, InstructSAM’s confidence-free APnc results underscore its robustness.

novel classes. ‘-’ means data missing due to limited reproducibility. ∅indicates model lacking the
segmentation ability. APnc is reported for InstructSAM, while values in gray for other methods are

Comparison with open-vocabulary detection methods on out-of-distribution datasets
To compare with open-vocabulary methods that include DIOR into training, we compare the zero-shot
performance on two out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets:
• xBD [18] is a large-scale building damage assessment dataset with spatial resolution below 0.8m.
The test set includes 933 pre- and post-disaster image pairs with instance-level building masks.
We use pre-disaster images to evaluate object counting and detection with the single category
“building”.
• Aerial Maritime Drone Large [30] is a drone-based object detection dataset with 74 aerial
maritime images and 1,151 bounding boxes. Categories include “docks”, “boats”, “lifts”, “jetskis”,
and “cars”. The entire dataset is used for zero-shot evaluation.
Table 11 shows that LAE-DINO, trained on LAE-1M (including “building”), achieves the highest
detection F1-core (50.6) on xBD. On Aerial Maritime Drone, however, LAE-DINO detects only boats,
even struggling with docks and cars despite semantic similarity to harbor and vehicle categories in
training. Moreover, the confidence-based detectors (OWL, CASTDet, LAE-DINO) require dataset-

Selection of prompt format
We conduct five independent experiments evaluating Qwen2.5-VL and GPT-4o’s open-vocabulary
counting ability on NWPU-VHR-10 using Markdown and JSON prompts. Table 12 shows the mean
accuracies and standard deviations. Qwen2.5-VL exhibits only a 1.2% difference in mean accuracy
between Markdown and JSON, with zero standard deviation for both. GPT-4o shows slight variability:
82.38% ± 0.94 (Markdown) and 82.68% ± 0.39 (JSON). These results indicate that these LVLM
counters maintain relatively stable performance across different prompt formats.

Broader impacts
InstructSAM demonstrates a strong ability to recognize objects in remote sensing imagery with
versatile instructions. It accelerates large-scale mapping applications, further supporting public
agencies and humanitarian organizations in critical areas such as poverty mapping, disaster response.
Its training-free paradigm and near-constant inference speed lower computational costs, decreasing
carbon emissions and broadening access to remote sensing applications in resource-limited settings.
InstructSAM’s capabilities also raise privacy concerns as the spatial resolution of satellite imagery is
growing higher. Hallucinations or misclassifications, stemming from biases in pre-trained models
may produce unreliable outputs, require user verification to ensure accuracy.
